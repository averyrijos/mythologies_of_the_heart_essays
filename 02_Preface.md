## Preface

>"_Writing is that neutral, composite, oblique space where our subject slips away, the negative where all identity is lost, starting with the very identity of the body writing_."- _Roland Barthes, The Pleasure of the Text_

In The Death of the Author, Roland Barthes argues that the meaning of a text is not dictated by the author's intentions or biography but emerges in the act of reading. Once a work is published, it ceases to belong to the writer and is instead claimed by the reader, who reshapes its significance through interpretation. This radical shift in literary criticism—away from the authorial voice and toward the autonomy of the text—epitomized much of twentieth-century thought. The artist, once the sovereign creator, was decentered, and in this decentering, the art itself gained a kind of freedom.

We cannot know ‘who is speaking,’ or, put another way, we cannot identify ‘an author,’ because writing itself, or text, or textuality, has a certain characteristic that removes ‘voice’ and ‘origin.’ This is a poststructural viewpoint: that everything exists as an interrelated text, that there is no singular identity, only an agglomeration of sedimented cultural and historical forces. But what if this absence is a site of possibility? What if it gestures not toward a static human nature but toward perpetual becoming?

It is within this space of becoming that I situate my work—the nexus where identity, language, and power collapse and reassemble. This essay entitled “Mythologies of the Heart” is an exploration of how we construct the self through narrative, how the heart, both as an organ and as a metaphor, becomes a contested site of meaning. The heart is an organ of fiction; it beats in rhythms we do not fully control, and its betrayals are often more literary than medical. I am interested in how the heart is written into Being, how its failures and fractures are mapped through language, how desire and grief inscribe themselves onto the body and the inner geographies of the imagination. The heart is not merely an affective metaphor - it is a political battleground, a terrain where the self is made and unmade, where dominant structures attempt to dictate who is allowed to feel, to long, to suffer, and ultimately, to dream.

I write to make Derrida bleed and Didion theorize. This book, then, in some ways is that very manifesto, my rebellion, and my offering—a reimagining of creative nonfiction as a site of both radical theoretical and emotional possibility. I write not to document experience but to dismantle the boundaries between philosophy, memoir, and activism, forging a new language for what it means to exist in—and resist—the Machine’s logic. At its core, _Mythologies of the Heart_ is an experiment in form and thought, where footnotes become nervous systems, subway platforms intersect with quantum fields, and grief metastasizes into a methodology for revolution.

I begin by reclaiming Roland Barthes’ “mythologies,” not as tools of ideological critique but as generative existential structures. Here, the subway station is no mere transit zone but a Deleuzian war machine, its fluorescent hum a chorus of becoming. The bureaucratic labyrinths I’ve navigated across time and space are not just Kafkaesque nightmares—they are biopolitical blueprints, their sterile language dissected in real time through unsent letters to Victoria, a ghost who haunts these pages. The footnotes littered throughout the text are not citations. They are, in some ways, a parallel text, pulsing with theoretical fervor. Wittgenstein’s “limits of language” collide with the metallic taste of grief as I fail to articulate my cousin Caleb’s murder; Augé’s “non-places” bleed into collegiate Gothic architecture, exposing ivy-draped façades as monuments to neoliberal aspiration. This is theory made flesh, philosophy that sweats and bleeds.

Central to this work is _The Politics of the Dreamable_—a praxis of resistance forged in liminal spaces. I reject the flattening gaze of algorithms and carceral systems, opting instead to occupy voids: the lacunae between footnotes, the arrhythmia of a heart denied closure, the bureaucratic interstices where meaning dissolves. Caleb’s death is not just a personal tragedy but a case study in systemic violence, analyzed through a fusion of critical race theory and quantum realism. Love, too, becomes a battleground. My unsent letters to a former love of mine, Victoria, are not confessional indulgences but Derridean specters, haunting the text with what might have been. In these spaces, I help to embody _micro-emancipations_: acts of refusal as small as a skipped meeting, as vast as redefining love itself as a “non-place” of perpetual becoming.

The heart, often dismissed as sentimental, becomes my phenomenal laboratory. I practice _cardio-phenomenology_—tracking how joy, grief, and longing reshape our internal geographies. To love under late capitalism, I argue, is to dwell in a haunted non-place: a Schrödinger’s Gadfly, both present and disruptive, yet perpetually unobserved. This emotional onto-epistemology challenges the history of Western philosophy’s mind-body binary, insisting that the heart _knows_ in ways the intellect could never parse. When I write “the heart is an organ of fiction,” I confess its role in metabolizing trauma into bearable myth—but also its power to fictionalize new futures.

Structurally, this work is a rhizome. Its footnotes deterritorialize the text, inviting readers to choose their path: linger with Baudrillard’s simulacra, surface for air with Victoria’s ghost, or trace the algorithmic violence embedded in subway delay announcements. The form itself is the argument—a rejection of linear authority, a manifesto in fragments in the lineage of Fernando Pessoa. To engage with this work is to participate in its rebellion. I offer no tidy conclusions, only urgent provocations: Can a love letter be a Post-Marxist critique? Does Affect encode resistance? Can we weaponize erasure against Machineries that have rendered it invisible? _Mythologies of the Heart, then,_ is not just an essay but an insurrection—one fought with citations, arrhythmias, and the relentless belief that another world is not only dreamable, but possible. Here, in the gaps between what is said and unsaid, I build altars to the possible. This is creative nonfiction reimagined as theoretical revolt - beyond the confines of the Ivory Tower.

The struggle I face is the gap between wanting to express what’s inside me and the feeling that I can’t fully do so. But I don’t see this as a flaw—it’s just part of how things are. Language itself is limiting, and in many ways, the limits of language reflect the limits of our world. Change, then, often begins in the mind, in those quiet moments of dreaming, wishing, or imagining. These dreams are often subconscious, desires buried deep within us that eventually emerge as what I call mythologies. These mythologies are a type of autotheory - they are the philosophical fictions we narrativize to ourselves to understand who we were, who we are, and who we might become.

In my work, when I broach the topic of mythologies, I do not mean fairy tales or fantasies. More specifically, I am highlighting the deeper stories that shape our existence. They include things like the dream of true love, the ideal of a happy ending, or the promise of the American Dream. These myths are important because they exist across time and space - they often have historical roots, offer meaning in the present, and project our desires into the future. They’re not imaginary constructs - they represent what we desire so deeply that they shape our lives. In this way, myths are not false, but rather, they are things that haven’t yet been fully realized, things we haven’t wished for enough to make real. Myths are constructs that shape reality.

Barthes' "Mythologies" (1957) profoundly sets the foundation for this conceptual framework. In this seminal work, he examines how everyday cultural phenomena - from wrestling matches to detergent advertisements - function as carriers of ideological meaning. For Barthes, myths are not ancient tales but modern signifying systems that transform history into nature, making cultural constructs appear inevitable and universal. These myths serve to naturalize the status quo, rendering social constructions as seemingly self-evident truths.

_Mythologies of the Heart_ goes beyond what Barthes had discussed regarding myths being just ideological or cultural artifacts. I see myths and fictions as concrete, existential structures. Myths create the limits of what’s possible and shape and mold what gets actualized in the Real. They’re not merely stories we tell to make sense of things; they’re foundational to how we experience reality.

Within the context of my project, I both draw from and push beyond Barthes' conception. While I acknowledge myths as ideological tools that shape perception, I also recognize their generative potential. Unlike Barthes, who primarily focused on demystifying myths to expose their ideological functions, I am interested in how myths can be deliberately reconstructed to imagine new possibilities. The mythologies I explore are not simply to be deconstructed—though that critical stance remains essential—but also to be reimagined as vehicles for creating alternate futures and identities.

My approach transforms Barthes' primarily diagnostic work into a prescriptive one: if myths construct our reality, then consciously crafting new myths becomes a revolutionary act. In "Mythologies of the Heart," then, I examine how the heart itself becomes mythologized through medical, romantic, and political discourses, and how these mythologies might be rewritten to allow for more expansive understandings of embodiment, desire, and connection.

The Artist-Philosopher fits naturally into this narrative as someone who bridges the gap between desire and reality, myth and materiality. In “The Artist-Philosopher and New Philosophy,” scholar George Smith highlights the bias against Pyrrhonian skepticism and the Poet-Philosophers of the Pre-Socratic Grecian era. As for myself, the Artist-Philosopher embodies the role of both creator and thinker - someone who not only _dreams_ but also reflects deeply on those dreams, understanding them as more than personal wishes but as structural forces that venture to shape the world. The Artist-Philosopher is attuned to the mythologies that govern existence, but rather than simply accepting them, they interrogate and reframe them, reshaping the very language and structures that define our experience of reality.

In a way, the Artist-Philosopher is someone who navigates the tension between the unspoken and the expressible. They are keenly aware of the limitations of language, yet they persist in trying to articulate what’s inside them, knowing fully well that this articulation is never fully congruent. But it is through this fallible expression that they create meaning. The Artist-Philosopher is driven by a desire to expose the mythologies that limit us while simultaneously participating in the creation of new myths—ones that can open up possibilities for personal and collective transformation.

For me, this process is not just about producing art or philosophy in isolation. It’s about recognizing that the myths we inherit shape the boundaries of what we believe to be possible. The Artist-Philosopher understands that desire, imagination, and creation are doubly intertwined with the material world. By questioning existing myths and creating new ones, the Artist-Philosopher challenges the boundaries of what we think we can achieve, pushing the peripheries of reality to include what was once considered impossible.

When philosophy presents itself as speaking from "nowhere in particular" or from the position of pure reason, it conceals the actual conditions that enable its discourse. The presumption of universality can function as a sleight of hand that obscures philosophy's participation in systems of privilege and exclusion. Who gets to speak as a philosopher? Whose experiences are deemed sufficiently universal to count as philosophical reflection? These questions reveal how philosophy's purported universality may actually serve to _reinforce_ existing hierarchies rather than _challenge_ them.

Thus, for me, the essay as an art form is necessarily political. It is inherently violent. To move, to unsettle, to rupture perception, this is the aim of its craft. An essay that shatters complacency, that quickens the pulse or leaves an open wound, is an essay that has fulfilled its purpose. In _“A Philosophy of the Essay: Scepticism, Experience and Style_," Erin Plunkett offers a well-executed exploration of the essay as a distinctive philosophical medium. The book delves deeply into how this literary form transcends conventional philosophical writing by embodying a unique approach to inquiry and expression. Plunkett aptly demonstrates how the essay's inherent qualities—its flexibility, reflexivity, and embrace of subjectivity—enable it to engage with fundamental philosophical questions in ways that systematic treatises or formal academic writing cannot accomplish.

The essay form, as Plunkett argues – and as I put forth here - allows for a more authentic philosophical engagement with the complexities of human experience precisely because it does not pretend to offer closure or absolute certainties. Instead, it creates a space where thinking can unfold organically, where contradictions can coexist, and where the contingency of knowledge is acknowledged rather than concealed. This makes the essay particularly well-suited to addressing philosophical problems that resist systematic or dialectical resolution. Albert Camus wrote that The Absurd might be "A lucid invitation to live and to create in the very midst of the desert." I myself write from these deserts, from margins that resist stability, from the precipice of language itself as it stammers and reshapes the very contours of collective thought.

If the philosopher’s task, according to Gilles Deleuze, is to invent conceptual tools, the essayist’s role, by extension, becomes one of experimentation, problematization, and synthesis. The essayist, in turn, operates as a cartographer of concepts, charting pathways through vast territories of thought while refusing to settle into fixed interpretations. The essay as a medium, then, becomes a machine for producing new realities, challenging readers to think with the text rather than about it. As an extension of being an essayist, my artistic praxis as a whole is further guided by Deleuze’s concept of Becoming-Minoritarian, an approach that deterritorializes dominant structures, embracing fragmentation and instability as modes of resistance. It is a process of unraveling normative perspectives—not to replace them with a fixed counterpoint but to create a space where the unspoken, the exiled, and the liminal come into articulation.

My interdisciplinary practice spans autotheory and scholarly critique. My research paper ‘Posthumanist Phenomenology and Artificial Intelligence’ (in peer review) examines how algorithmic systems flatten human complexity, a tension I explore creatively in scenes where subway commuters become spectral entities, their individuality erased by the Machine’s logic. This dual engagement with theory and narrative allows me to interrogate modernity’s crises from multiple vantage points. I seek not a human-centered perspective, nor a so-called "objective" view from nowhere, but rather a vision from the fringes—a Deimos on an erratic orbit, a voice speaking in slippage, in rupture, in the spaces where meaning unmoors itself.

The literary arts and I have not always been natural bedfellows. As a child, I struggled to express myself. But, sensing this, my prescient mother once told me that the paper is my friend. It has no eyes to see, no ears to hear, no hands to touch. The only way it can understand me is through the words I write. That moment shaped me. Writing from that moment on became more than an act of putting thoughts on a page—it became a wish to be understood, a means of being validated, heard, and listened to. To communicate what was deeply hidden in the viscera of my very Being.

For me, writing is not simply a creative act; it is a space where I am most at home in a world increasingly hostile to my existence. As a Latino, a first-generation college student, a second-generation American navigating cultural erasure, and a person diagnosed with schizotypal, panic, and bipolar disorders, I am indeed an incongruous piece amidst the world’s jigsaw-dance. Writing is not just my craft—it is an act of survival, a means of asserting presence in a world that often seeks to render me illegible. It is where I carve out space for the fragmented, the dissonant, the unassimilable. A radical critique of the forces that seek to define and control us, urging the reader to reimagine what is possible beyond the strictures of the profit principle and bureaucratic entrenchment.

Through language, I refuse this erasure. I write not to conform but to rupture, to trace the outlines of an identity that is fluid, shifting, and uncontained by imposed narratives. My work, ultimately, engages with a praxis entitled “The Politics of the Dreamable” - the radical potential embedded in imagining beyond what is structurally enforced as ‘real.’ To propose that what is "dreamable" is also actionable. If our realities are shaped by hegemonic narratives—of race, class, gender, neurotypicality—then what potential futures can we dream into existence? Who decides who gets the privilege to dream and imagine? And more importantly, who gets to awaken from unending nightmares? Writing, then, is a way of opening portals to what is yet unrealized, of insisting on the viability of worlds that have yet to come. Actualizing the _virtual_ and the _potential_ into _the Real_.
