## Deterritorializations

In this work, and as an embodiment of praxis, we must deterritorialize<sup><sup>[\[14\]](#endnote-14)</sup></sup>, in a Deleuzian fashion<sup><sup>[\[15\]](#endnote-15)</sup></sup> this characterization’s fair but slightly misaligned pessimism on its prognosis of Supermodernity (of course, life can only be understood backward but must be lived forward.<sup><sup>[\[16\]](#endnote-16)</sup></sup>) While Augé’s diagnosis of non-places as sites of alienation is incisive, his framing risks foreclosing their latent potential. If we shift our gaze—from a critical anthropology to a Deleuzian ontology—non-places emerge not merely as sites of loss, but as thresholds of becoming.

In a recasting of Auge’s mold, non-spaces now can be _seen_. Rather than merely spaces co-opted by the Machine, non-places might be seen to lay the groundwork for its very undoing. Within non-places lie generative thresholds, liminal spaces, _virtualities_<sup><sup>[\[17\]](#endnote-17)</sup></sup> with dynamic undercurrents that untether us from the ever-tightening pull of majoritarian norms. They can be re-casted as _planes of immanence_,<sup><sup>[\[18\]](#endnote-18)</sup></sup> fields of latent potential, where forces are interwoven and continuously in flux. In this framing, non-places do not simply strip identity; they open onto new possibilities for becoming. The field operates with no external forces or transcendent entities influencing it, riposting against the hegemony of privileging substance over absence. It is a frame to understand reality as a continuous, dynamic field rather than merely a plethora of discretely separate or static entities.

So, while this account retains Augé’s emphasis on _absence_ and _fluidity_, I instead subvert the negativity of absence through the _ethics of affirmation_, re-grounding the concept for reimagination. In other words, instead of viewing non-places as alienating thresholds, this account sees them as spaces of perpetual becoming – transmogrified into a process philosophy. These non-places then become zones expressing the in-between, sites that resist the rigidity of identity and the fixity of _substance metaphysics_<sup><sup>[\[19\]](#endnote-19)</sup></sup>, and its engulfing logic of closure. They become an _Event_,<sup><sup>[\[20\]](#endnote-20)</sup></sup> a radical milestone that disrupts the continuity of _The Machine_, creating possibilities for, in this case, _Mythologies of the Heart_ <sup><sup>[\[21\]](#endnote-21)</sup></sup>.

I will provide an example here. In the pulsating rhythm of urban life, the subway stands as a quintessential non-place and a striking symbol of Augé’s concept of Supermodernity. It serves as a space of transit rather than arrival, defined more by its primary function than by any intrinsic meaning. Commuters shuffle through the corridors, focused on destinations that lie elsewhere, often oblivious to the shared experiences unfolding around them. In Augé’s view, the subway epitomizes alienation—a liminal space devoid of rootedness or identity.

But what if we were to challenge (or subvert) this perspective, using the Deleuzian lens of “planes of immanence”? Instead of viewing the subway as a void, we could see it as a site of perpetual potential Becoming. Here, the subway transforms into a generative threshold, an organismic plane where possibilities swirl beneath its mere utilitarian function. It is no longer just a conduit for movement; it becomes a locus of intersecting lives, desires, and possibilities. In this space, strangers, briefly close together, share an experience untethered from the rigid markers of identity that define their above-ground lives. The businessman in his tailored suit, the student clutching a worn backpack, and the street performer strumming a melancholic tune—all of them contribute to a collective whole, momentarily unified by a shared sensory experience: the rumble of the train and the hum of fluorescent lights, creating a sense of solidarity amid capitalistic alienation and the influence of its invisible hand.

In this reframing, the subway resists what is known as “substance metaphysics.” This philosophical framework prioritizes stable, enduring entities or "substances" as the fundamental building blocks of reality. It assumes that entities possess intrinsic, fixed essences that define their identities and persist even through change. Rooted in Aristotelian and Cartesian traditions, substance metaphysics emphasizes the stability and continuity of these entities over time. However, the subway is not a space that imposes a static definition on its occupants; rather, it dissolves boundaries and allows for fluid interconnection. It embodies a plane of immanence, where identities blur and new relational possibilities emerge. The absence of rootedness, in this context, signifies liberation—the freedom to exist as part of an evolving whole, unmoored from the hierarchical norms that shape hegemonic life.

In this conception, the subway becomes an Event in Badiou’s sense: a rupture that interrupts the continuity of the Machine, opening spaces for reimagination. Within its tunnels, the rigidity of the above-ground world softens. A chance conversation between strangers can spark a profound connection; a fleeting glance across the aisle might ignite a transformative recognition. These encounters, though potentially ephemeral, hold the power to destabilize the prevailing narrative of isolation and the instrumental modes of thinking that dominate modern life. Moreover, the subway embodies a type of process philosophy, expressing the "in-between" as a site of perpetual motion and becoming. It is never static, never closed. The train arrives and departs, passengers come and go, and yet the arrangements persist, ever-changing but continuous. This dynamism reflects a deeper truth about reality: that it is not composed of discrete, fixed entities but of a ceaseless interplay of forces and flows. Of networks of connection and assemblages. Of collectives.

By reimagining the subway as a plane of immanence, we subvert its absence into a fertile ground for new possibilities. It becomes a site where the rigidity of identity and the totalizing closure of substance metaphysics are resisted, allowing for the emergence of _Mythologies of the Heart_. In this way, the subway, far from being a space of intransience, becomes a space of generative potential, a threshold where the imagination is untethered and _the_ _Machine_ disrupted. The subway, like all non-places, holds within it the seeds of its own redefinition. It is a liminal threshold, where the everyday and the extraordinary coexist, patiently waiting for those who are willing to _see_ it.

Non-places, in this view, do not merely negate meaning; they are disjunctive logics, subversive schemas—radical breaks in the dominant order that allow for new structures of identity and belonging to emerge. Disorderly “free radicals.” They become representations of _emotional constructs_ <sup><sup>[\[22\]](#endnote-22)</sup></sup> that are no longer confined by the postulates of men but are instead dynamic, emergent, and immanent-in-themselves. They are entities that exist and operate entirely within their own framework, without relying on external variables or peripheral influences. This expanded formulation of non-places possesses the key attributes of Augé's framing - absence, fluidity, and dislocation - but where the concept is subverted and subsumed by its own logic.

At the heart of our separate accounts lies a paradox: non-places are defined by their absence of place-like qualities, yet they remain profoundly influential in shaping the collective _lifeworlds_<sup><sup>[\[23\]](#endnote-23)</sup></sup> of contemporary subjectivities.

If identity, history, and relationality are markers for what constitutes a "place," then can we consider cults or nationalist movements as non-places or something else? These groups, often defined by strict adherence to particular ideologies and a shared sense of belonging, cultivate powerful emotional ties and a deep sense of identity. The fluidity of these movements, shaped by shifting allegiances and fragmented histories, challenges traditional notions of fixed, rooted places. Can these movements, built on the dynamics of collective identity, transcend the boundaries of physical place? Under the criterion of identity, history, and relationality, might these movements themselves be considered places—dynamic, relational constructs that exist outside the traditional geographical or physical realm? If we accept that non-places are not simply absences but sites of emergence, then what of people, who embody histories and relationships in ways more complex than fixed spaces ever could? If non-places destabilize conventional notions of relationality, then might _individuals_ themselves, in their layered identities, be the most profound and mutable of places? For Augé, this dilemma might create a tangle of thorns; for him the quandary signals a loss of human relationality and rootedness. For this expanded account, however, the lacunae itself become a present factor – not as a lack but as a site of potentiality.

## The Geography of the Self

Every individual bears within them the residual imprints of relationships, moments, and decisions that have shaped their being Just as a place retains its history in its stones, ruins, or atmosphere, people carry their histories in their bodies, minds, and emotional landscapes. In our view, a _place_ is not merely defined by its physical boundaries or its material terrain but by the potential relationships it fosters. In this sense, the parks we frequent, marketplaces where we shop and mingle, and the homes and refuges we share and invite others into are, of course, places. These are significant places because they are spaces of exponential interconnection and relationality, even with the space’s functional purposivism.

But just as places are defined by their cultural and historical narratives, _people_ are shaped by their personal histories and identities. Each individual carries within them sedimented layers of experiences, memories, and relationalities that create a unique _geography of the self_ <sup><sup>[\[24\]](#endnote-24)</sup></sup>. Consider the notion that a place can hold the imprint of both events and occurrences. Similarly, individuals act as repositories of their lived experiences, becoming dynamic spaces where past and present intersect. In this sense, people are not static entities but evolving sites of narrative, place, and identity.

So, in a similar vein, people _themselves_ function as places. They are terrains to explore, mountains to climb, and complex ecosystems to engage with. Relationships, whether familial, romantic, professional, or social, unfold through individuals and groups, forming intricate, navigable landscapes. To truly know someone is to step into their inner sanctum, to traverse the continuities and ruptures within their emotional and psychological landscapes. These are sceneries painted with the brushstrokes of treasured memories, profound fears, and towering aspirations, each elementality contributing to the depth and fluidity of the person’s internal geography.<sup><sup>[\[25\]](#endnote-25)</sup></sup>

Memory itself, as a foundational element of personhood, functions as a map for the internal geography of the self. Just as physical places are imbued with history, memories hold the _traces_ of lived experiences. They are spaces within us where past events are reconstructed and re-experienced. For instance, a childhood home may no longer physically exist, but within the individual's memory, it remains a vivid, navigable space—a place as real as any “real” externalized environment.

Emotions operate similarly, creating constructs that shape how we perceive and interact with the world. Joy, grief, longing, or love transform the internal terrain of a person, becoming sites of profound personal significance. These emotional places are deeply tied to the _Mythologies of the Heart_, as they embody the narratives we hold onto to navigate life's uncertainties and losses. Love, in particular, becomes a "place" where we dwell—a sanctuary, a battlefield, or, what we will further in this book, a _non-place_ – a location of interest that defies simple categorization​.

Just as we inhabit our internal spaces incessantly, we also dwell within the places constituted by others. Relationships often involve entering the emotional and narrative spaces of another person—learning their histories, navigating their memories, and sharing their dreams. This mutual cohabitation highlights the amalgamation of distinct human lifeworlds, where each person is both a host of their own world and a visitor within the worlds of others.

In the context of the _Mythologies_, this mutually sustaining process is central to the dynamics it reveals. Love, loss, and longing are not solitary experiences but shared journeys through the landscapes of each other's hearts. These shared places become the Mythologies we co-create, the maps we follow, and the sanctuaries we return to, even as they remain incomplete or logically imperfect. In _Mythologies_ these centers become vital to the narratives we construct to endure and make sense of our existence. How we rationalize grief, and how we move forward from the kiss of bittersweet ends.

The "heart," as a center, holds a collection of memories, emotions, and connections—each palimpsestic layer upon the other, forming a living map of our personal and relational histories. These _Mythologies_ are the narratives we tell ourselves about who we are, who we love, where we come from, and where we aspire to go. They can be both illusions and truths, as well as both illusory _and_ true simultaneously, offering comfort and clarity even as they obscure the messiness and noise of reality.

A person here might construct a narrative around a lost love, idealizing the relationship as a perfect sanctuary. This _Mythology_, in turn, becomes a place they return to in moments of solitude, not as a literal memory but as a reconstructed emotional space. It is here that the heart's _Mythologies_ overlap with the concept of non-places: these spaces are temporary, are found in transition, and often defined more by absence than presence, yet they are crucial to how embodied subjects navigate their memories, lives, and aspirations.

The constitutive elements of people - memories, emotions, relationships – then, are revealed as dynamic places that mirror the paradoxes of non-places. They are transient yet permanent, absent yet present, fixed yet fluid. These internal places, tied to the _Mythologies of the Heart_, are not just constructs of survival but powerful sites of potential for the imagination. They remind us that to be human is to inhabit a complex terrain of the self, to dwell in the spaces between what is and what could be, and to find meaning in the _Mythologies_ that sustain us.

The gaps in continuity described, then, are not sterile voids but living spaces where new combinations of thought, identity, and subjectivity can emerge. This reframing aligns with certain phenomenological<sup><sup>[\[26\]](#endnote-26)</sup></sup> strains that explore absence as an active and generative force. <sup><sup>[\[27\]](#endnote-27)</sup></sup> Absence becomes a condition of possibility for new ways of being, a notion that resonates deeply with contemporary critiques of ontological and epistemic conceptions of fixity and closure – and all their various forms.<sup><sup>[\[28\]](#endnote-28)</sup></sup>

_Closure_ is not merely the conclusion of an event or a narrative; it is, more significantly, a premature termination of possibility. It forecloses the potential for future experiences, shutting off the pathways through which alternative futures, dreams, and realities might emerge. Closure creates the illusion of finality, sealing off the unspoken, the unexplored, and the unresolved, leaving a world reduced in scope and richness. _Fixity_, similarly, represents an unyielding adherence to a particular state of being—a refusal to embrace the natural dynamism and fluidity of existence. It is the cementing of identity, thought, and feeling into rigid, immutable forms that resist the flux of life, denying the multiplicity and unpredictability that define human experience.

Within the exploration of the heart and its myriad spaces, a resistance to closure and fixity is not just important but essential. The _Mythologies of the Heart_, as both a concept and mode of being, thrives in openness and fluidity - in its capacity to remain porous to the world’s ambiguities and contradictions. To resist closure is to keep alive the potential for growth, transformation, and reinterpretation. It is to allow our experiences, no matter how seemingly final, to remain open-ended, capable of being revisited and reimagined. Likewise, opposing fixity enables us to acknowledge and embrace the multiplicity of our inter-being—the profound interconnectedness that reveals we are not static entities but ever-changing assemblages. Ever-becoming processes.

I have had many cherished, deeply meaningful relationships that I once believed would last a lifetime. Yet, they were marked by abrupt closures, sudden ruptures that left behind an aching sense of discontinuity. These moments, while often painful, altered not only the way I perceived the world but also how I moved through it, interacted with it, and imagined my place within it. In hindsight, I see that the closures I perceived were, perhaps, illusions—constructs born out of a mistaken instinct for self-preservation. By withdrawing, by mentally and emotionally closing myself off to the ongoing dialogue between the world and my heart, I denied myself encounters that might have been rich with love, community, and hope. What did I fear? Perhaps it was the pain of losing yet another cherished connection, the unbearable weight of beginning anew. Yet, as I reflect now, I see that the very act of closing off was itself the most profound loss.

This interplay between closure and fixity mirrors the contradictions inherent in the human condition. On the one hand, we crave stability and certainty—a framework within which to make sense of our experiences and define ourselves. On the other hand, we yearn for freedom, for the possibility of wandering through uncharted territories of the heart and mind, unencumbered by the weight of what has been. These competing desires ultimately create a tension that defines much of human life.

In this tension, Mythologies become vital conceptual personae, offering a way to navigate the space between closure and fluidity, between fixity and openness. Mythologies, far from being escapist fabrications, are imaginative constructs through which we process the complexities of existence. They do not necessarily transcend or oppose closure and fixity but affirm their presence while simultaneously offering alternative arrangements. Through Mythologies, we find the tools to hold space for the unknown, to see that closure and fluidity can coexist as commingling chapters of the same story.

By maintaining an openness to the fluidity of our narratives, we honor the intricate and often contradictory nature of our emotions and memories. This openness allows us to reconcile with the past, to heal from its wounds, and to discover new paths forward even in the face of loss and change. It teaches us that even within finality, there exists the seeds of possibility—an open invitation to reimagine what was thought to be closed and to embrace the unknown as a fertile ground for new beginnings. In rejecting the rigidity of closure and fixity, we do not abandon the past but transform it into a dynamic element of our ongoing becoming. This is the paradox of the heart: it is both sanctuary and frontier, a space where the finite and the infinite meet in perpetual interplay.

In this way, _Mythologies_ do not merely reflect our lived experiences but actively shape them, inviting us to engage with the full spectrum of our humanity and to find meaning in the spaces between. The memory of a lost loved one, for instance, might initially feel like a source of pain, but over time their memory can transform into a memento of pride or strength, guiding future actions or planting the seeds for inspiring insights ones may have for the future. This transformation illustrates how internal places, much like external ones, can be sites of both preservation and reinvention, accenting the paradoxical nature of non-places. In this reimagining, non-places are imbued with a "_Politics of the Dreamable_ <sup><sup>[\[29\]](#endnote-29)</sup></sup>" – the affirmative interpretation of Augé's more detached introspections. If Augé sees highways and airports as zones where human significance evaporates, this account reads them as liminal thresholds, where meaning can reassemble in nonlinear, emergent, and self-organizing<sup><sup>[\[30\]](#endnote-30)</sup></sup> configurations. This _politics_ more plainly refers to the radical potential embedded within the mind's eye — the ability to envision alternate futures, to coexist with conflicting voices<sup><sup>[\[31\]](#endnote-31)</sup></sup>, and to challenge the _Machine_ by reasserting possibilities where there appears to be none. In a world increasingly defined by rationality, technology, and scientism, _dreaming itself_ becomes an act of resistance. It defies the constraints of what is often presented as "realistic" or "inevitable" by those who maintain control, inviting us to reject the totalizing narratives of permanence and inevitability.

14. The concept of “deterritorialization”, as developed in _A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia_, refers to the process by which established structures, meanings, or territories are destabilized or displaced. It signifies the breaking down of boundaries, whether physical, cultural, or conceptual, enabling new flows and connections. Often paired with reterritorialization, which involves the re-establishment of order or meaning in new contexts, deterritorialization highlights the dynamic and fluid nature of systems, identities, and spaces. _See Note 8_. [↑](#endnote-ref-14)

15. Which means, rhizomatically_._ The concept of the “rhizome,” as introduced in _A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia_, describes a non-hierarchical, decentralized, and interconnected mode of organization. Unlike the linear and rooted structure of a tree, the rhizome spreads in multiple directions, forming a network without a clear origin or endpoint. To deterritorialize rhizomatically means to challenge traditional models of knowledge, identity, and systems while simultaneously emphasize multiplicity, diversity, and lateral connections over singularity and vertical authority. _See Note 8_. [↑](#endnote-ref-15)

16. An aphorism attributed to Søren Kierkegaard, encapsulates here the paradoxical nature of human existence. While the events of life can only be fully comprehended in hindsight, life itself unfolds in the uncertainty of the present and the unknowability of the future. Kierkegaard explores this tension in _Journals and Papers_, where he reflects on the nature of temporality and existence, suggesting that understanding requires retrospection, yet action demands forward motion. This duality speaks to the existential challenge of living authentically, as one navigates the irreconcilable gap between knowing and being, past and future. See Søren Kierkegaard. _Journals and Papers_. Translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong, Indiana University Press, 1967. [↑](#endnote-ref-16)

17. _Virtualities_ refer to latent potentials or possibilities that exist within a system, awaiting actualization. In the philosophical framework of Deleuze, virtuality does not imply a lack of existence but rather denotes a realm of real potential distinct from concrete actuality. Virtualities are dynamic and generative potentials, offering a space for new configurations, forms, and connections to emerge. They underpin the transformative processes of becoming, challenging static or fixed understandings of identity, space, and systems. See Gilles Deleuze, _Difference and Repetition_, translated by Paul Patton, Columbia University Press, 1994, [↑](#endnote-ref-17)

18. This plane, as conceptualized by Deleuze (often in collaboration with Guattari), refers to a foundational, pre-conceptual field of pure potentiality and becoming. It is a realm where all entities, concepts, and events exist in a state of interconnected flux, without hierarchy or transcendence. Unlike a transcendental framework that imposes external order, the plane of immanence is self-organizing and allows for the emergence of new forms of thought and existence. It serves as a philosophical ground for understanding how ideas and phenomena are constructed without recourse to external metaphysical structures. See Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, _What Is Philosophy?_, translated by Hugh Tomlinson and Graham Burchell, Columbia University Press, 1994. [↑](#endnote-ref-18)

19. “Substance metaphysics” refers to a philosophical framework, originating in Aristotelian and Cartesian traditions, that prioritizes the concept of stable, enduring entities or “substances” as the fundamental building blocks of reality. This perspective assumes that entities have intrinsic, fixed essences that define their identity and persist through change. In contrast, critiques of substance metaphysics, such as those found in process philosophy (e.g., Whitehead) and poststructuralist thought (e.g., Deleuze), challenge this rigidity by emphasizing flux, becoming, and relationality over fixed essences. For a critique of substance metaphysics. _See Note 15_ [↑](#endnote-ref-19)

20. In Alain Badiou’s philosophy, an “_event_” is a radical occurrence that disrupts the established order of being and knowledge, opening up the possibility for new truths. Events are not part of the regular state of things. Instead, they emerge unpredictably and reconfigure the conditions of thought and action. For Badiou, fidelity to an event involves recognizing and committing to its transformative potential, often in politics, science, art, or love. Events challenge the dominance of established structures, creating room for novelty and innovation. See Alain Badiou, _Being and Event_, translated by Oliver Feltham, Continuum, 2005. [↑](#endnote-ref-20)

21. _Mythologies of the Heart_, as we will see, delve into the spaces between presence and absence, blurring the boundaries of fiction, philosophy, and lived experience. It explores liminality as both a metaphor and a mode of being, drawing on concepts like Marc Augé's "non-places" and Derrida's "traces" to frame the _heart_ as a site of both alienation and potentiality. I interrogate how certain societal structures erase individual presence, rendering many minoritarian groups invisible, while also reclaiming these unseen spaces as fertile grounds for revolutionary thought and emotional transformation. These "Mythologies" are not fabrications, but are cartographies of the in-between, charting paths through love, memory, and loss to help imagine novel ways of being and belonging​. [↑](#endnote-ref-21)

22. Emotion operates similarly to memory, creating constructs that shape how we perceive and interact with the world. Joy, grief, longing, or love transform the internal terrain of a person, becoming sites of profound personal significance. These emotional places are deeply tied to the Mythologies of the Heart, as they embody the narratives we tell ourselves to navigate life's uncertainties and losses. Love, in particular, becomes a "place" where we dwell—a sanctuary, a battlefield, or, what we will further in this essay, a non-place – a location that defies reductionist classification. [↑](#endnote-ref-22)

23. The term “lifeworld” (_Lebenswelt_) originates in the phenomenological philosophy of Edmund Husserl and refers to the pre-reflective, everyday world of lived experience. It encompasses the cultural, social, and historical contexts in which individuals exist and interact. Lifeworlds are the foundational, taken-for-granted structures of meaning that shape how people perceive, understand, and navigate the world. They are deeply influenced by collective traditions, linguistic frameworks, and individual subjectivity, acting as the background against which all experience occurs. This concept has been further developed in sociology by Jürgen Habermas, who contrasts the lifeworld with the systemic mechanisms of modern society, such as markets and bureaucracies. For more on the concept, see Edmund Husserl, _The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology: An Introduction to Phenomenological Philosophy_, translated by David Carr, Northwestern University Press, 1970. [↑](#endnote-ref-23)

24. These geographies parallel the shaping of physical places with the formation of personal identity. Just as landscapes are formed by natural forces and historical events, the self is shaped by an accretion of sense-experiences, relationships, and memories, creating a unique and dynamic internal terrain. This notion views identity as a process of becoming, marked by the residual imprints of pivotal events and interactions. Like how battlefields bear scars of war or sacred sites resonate with devotion, individuals carry within them traces of their histories. The "geography of the self" positions identity as a relational and evolving construct, shaped by the interplay of personal and collective narratives, and by the fluid interaction between the past and present. [↑](#endnote-ref-24)

25. Internal geography, more technically, refers to _ontological situatedness_. This refers to the condition of being embedded within a specific context of existence, shaped by the interplay of one's identity, environment, and relational structures. It acknowledges that our understanding of self and reality is not fixed but emerges through the dynamic interaction of historical, cultural, and phenomenological factors. This concept draws on Heidegger’s _Being-in-the-World_ (_Dasein_), emphasizing that our existence is always "thrown" into a pre-existing world of meaning and constraints. Heidegger describes this in _Being and Time_ as the fundamental structure of human existence (_Sein und Zeit_, 1927). Situatedness frames our ontological experience as inherently contingent, urging a recognition of how power, positionality, and the limits of perspective shape the possibilities of understanding and action within the world. See Martin Heidegger, _Being and Time_. Translated by John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson, Harper Perennial Modern Thought, 2008. [↑](#endnote-ref-25)

26. The term "phenomenological" refers to a philosophical approach that emphasizes the study of conscious experiences from the first-person perspective. It involves examining the structures of experience and consciousness to understand how we perceive and interpret the world around us. This approach is often associated with the works of philosophers like Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger [↑](#endnote-ref-26)

27. Merleau-Ponty explores the idea of absence as a generative force versus perception and existence. Merleau-Ponty challenges traditional notions of presence and absence, proposing that absence is not merely a void but an essential aspect of the perceptual world, allowing for the emergence of new ways of being and understanding. In this work, he discusses how absence, or the invisible, plays a key role in the experience of the visible and in the formation of meaning. This aligns with phenomenological perspectives that regard absence as an active space for potentiality, shaping the contours of identity, thought, and collective experience. See Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. _The Visible and the Invisible_. Translated by Alphonso Lingis, Northwestern University Press, 1968 [↑](#endnote-ref-27)

28. The dynamic interplay between closure and fixity mirrors contradictions inherent to the human condition. On one hand, we seek stability and certainty to make sense of our lives; on the other, we yearn for the freedom to explore uncharted territories of our hearts and minds. Mythologies, therefore, become vitally essential personae through which we navigate these tensions, offering spaces where the rigidity of closure and fixity can be transcended. By maintaining an openness to the fluidity of our narratives, we honor the complexities of our emotions and memories. We allow for the possibility of reconciliation, healing, and discovery, even in the face of loss and change [↑](#endnote-ref-28)

29. This _Politics_ refers to the radical potential inherent in the act of dreaming and envisioning alternate futures, presenting dreaming as an act of resistance against the constraints of the present reality. This concept challenges the accepted narratives of what is deemed realistic or inevitable, offering a space for reimagining the world beyond current systems of power, rationality, and hierarchy. It is not an escape but a deliberate engagement with possibility, particularly in non-places — those liminal, transient zones where meaning can be reformed in nonlinear, emergent ways. The politics of the dreamable foreground speculative thinking as fertile ground for collective liberation, enabling marginalized voices to shape new realities that defy systemic inertia and totalizing narratives. It asserts that through dreaming, one can reclaim spaces where the conventional rules no longer apply, making room for new modes of being and revolutionary change. [↑](#endnote-ref-29)

30. Self-organization (or _autopoiesis_) refers to a system's ability to maintain and reproduce itself through its own internal processes, without external direction or control. This concept, developed by biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, emphasizes how their capacity to autonomously create and regulate their own structures and functions characterizes living systems. In the context of the _Politics of the Dreamable_, self-organizing assemblages highlight the potential for meaning and order to emerge spontaneously and non-hierarchically, challenging the deterministic frameworks imposed by external authorities. Rather than relying on preordained structures, self-organizing systems enable the dynamic, emergent formation of new possibilities, much like the radical reimagining of the future through dreaming. See Maturana, Humberto R., and Francisco J. Varela. _Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living._ D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1980. [↑](#endnote-ref-30)

31. Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of _polyvocality_, introduced in his analysis of the novel in _The Dialogic Imagination_, refers to the coexistence and interaction of multiple voices or perspectives within a text. Rather than a singular, dominant voice, Bakhtin argues that polyvocality represents the interplay of various viewpoints, each with its own legitimacy, which challenges the idea of a unified, authoritative narrative. This idea of multiple, competing voices has been applied not only to literature but also to broader social and cultural contexts, emphasizing the complexity and diversity of discourse in shaping meaning. See Bakhtin, Mikhail. _The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays_. Edited by Michael Holquist, translated by Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist, University of Texas Press, 1981. [↑](#endnote-ref-31)
