## Deterritorializations

In this work, and as an embodiment of praxis, we must deterritorialize<sup><sup>[\[14\]](#endnote-14)</sup></sup>, in a Deleuzian fashion<sup><sup>[\[15\]](#endnote-15)</sup></sup> this characterization’s fair but slightly misaligned pessimism on its prognosis of Supermodernity (of course, life can only be understood backward but must be lived forward.<sup><sup>[\[16\]](#endnote-16)</sup></sup>) While Augé’s diagnosis of non-places as sites of alienation is incisive, his framing risks foreclosing their latent potential. If we shift our gaze—from a critical anthropology to a Deleuzian ontology—non-places emerge not merely as sites of loss, but as thresholds of becoming.

In a recasting of Auge’s mold, non-spaces now can be _seen_. Rather than merely spaces co-opted by the Machine, non-places might be seen to lay the groundwork for its very undoing. Within non-places lie generative thresholds, liminal spaces, _virtualities_<sup><sup>[\[17\]](#endnote-17)</sup></sup> with dynamic undercurrents that untether us from the ever-tightening pull of majoritarian norms. They can be re-casted as _planes of immanence_,<sup><sup>[\[18\]](#endnote-18)</sup></sup> fields of latent potential, where forces are interwoven and continuously in flux. In this framing, non-places do not simply strip identity; they open onto new possibilities for becoming. The field operates with no external forces or transcendent entities influencing it, riposting against the hegemony of privileging substance over absence. It is a frame to understand reality as a continuous, dynamic field rather than merely a plethora of discretely separate or static entities.

So, while this account retains Augé’s emphasis on _absence_ and _fluidity_, I instead subvert the negativity of absence through the _ethics of affirmation_, re-grounding the concept for reimagination. In other words, instead of viewing non-places as alienating thresholds, this account sees them as spaces of perpetual becoming – transmogrified into a process philosophy. These non-places then become zones expressing the in-between, sites that resist the rigidity of identity and the fixity of _substance metaphysics_<sup><sup>[\[19\]](#endnote-19)</sup></sup>, and its engulfing logic of closure. They become an _Event_,<sup><sup>[\[20\]](#endnote-20)</sup></sup> a radical milestone that disrupts the continuity of _The Machine_, creating possibilities for, in this case, _Mythologies of the Heart_ <sup><sup>[\[21\]](#endnote-21)</sup></sup>.

I will provide an example here. In the pulsating rhythm of urban life, the subway stands as a quintessential non-place and a striking symbol of Augé’s concept of Supermodernity. It serves as a space of transit rather than arrival, defined more by its primary function than by any intrinsic meaning. Commuters shuffle through the corridors, focused on destinations that lie elsewhere, often oblivious to the shared experiences unfolding around them. In Augé’s view, the subway epitomizes alienation—a liminal space devoid of rootedness or identity.

But what if we were to challenge (or subvert) this perspective, using the Deleuzian lens of “planes of immanence”? Instead of viewing the subway as a void, we could see it as a site of perpetual potential Becoming. Here, the subway transforms into a generative threshold, an organismic plane where possibilities swirl beneath its mere utilitarian function. It is no longer just a conduit for movement; it becomes a locus of intersecting lives, desires, and possibilities. In this space, strangers, briefly close together, share an experience untethered from the rigid markers of identity that define their above-ground lives. The businessman in his tailored suit, the student clutching a worn backpack, and the street performer strumming a melancholic tune—all of them contribute to a collective whole, momentarily unified by a shared sensory experience: the rumble of the train and the hum of fluorescent lights, creating a sense of solidarity amid capitalistic alienation and the influence of its invisible hand.

In this reframing, the subway resists what is known as “substance metaphysics.” This philosophical framework prioritizes stable, enduring entities or "substances" as the fundamental building blocks of reality. It assumes that entities possess intrinsic, fixed essences that define their identities and persist even through change. Rooted in Aristotelian and Cartesian traditions, substance metaphysics emphasizes the stability and continuity of these entities over time. However, the subway is not a space that imposes a static definition on its occupants; rather, it dissolves boundaries and allows for fluid interconnection. It embodies a plane of immanence, where identities blur and new relational possibilities emerge. The absence of rootedness, in this context, signifies liberation—the freedom to exist as part of an evolving whole, unmoored from the hierarchical norms that shape hegemonic life.

In this conception, the subway becomes an Event in Badiou’s sense: a rupture that interrupts the continuity of the Machine, opening spaces for reimagination. Within its tunnels, the rigidity of the above-ground world softens. A chance conversation between strangers can spark a profound connection; a fleeting glance across the aisle might ignite a transformative recognition. These encounters, though potentially ephemeral, hold the power to destabilize the prevailing narrative of isolation and the instrumental modes of thinking that dominate modern life. Moreover, the subway embodies a type of process philosophy, expressing the "in-between" as a site of perpetual motion and becoming. It is never static, never closed. The train arrives and departs, passengers come and go, and yet the arrangements persist, ever-changing but continuous. This dynamism reflects a deeper truth about reality: that it is not composed of discrete, fixed entities but of a ceaseless interplay of forces and flows. Of networks of connection and assemblages. Of collectives.

By reimagining the subway as a plane of immanence, we subvert its absence into a fertile ground for new possibilities. It becomes a site where the rigidity of identity and the totalizing closure of substance metaphysics are resisted, allowing for the emergence of _Mythologies of the Heart_. In this way, the subway, far from being a space of intransience, becomes a space of generative potential, a threshold where the imagination is untethered and _the_ _Machine_ disrupted. The subway, like all non-places, holds within it the seeds of its own redefinition. It is a liminal threshold, where the everyday and the extraordinary coexist, patiently waiting for those who are willing to _see_ it.

Non-places, in this view, do not merely negate meaning; they are disjunctive logics, subversive schemas—radical breaks in the dominant order that allow for new structures of identity and belonging to emerge. Disorderly “free radicals.” They become representations of _emotional constructs_ <sup><sup>[\[22\]](#endnote-22)</sup></sup> that are no longer confined by the postulates of men but are instead dynamic, emergent, and immanent-in-themselves. They are entities that exist and operate entirely within their own framework, without relying on external variables or peripheral influences. This expanded formulation of non-places possesses the key attributes of Augé's framing - absence, fluidity, and dislocation - but where the concept is subverted and subsumed by its own logic.

At the heart of our separate accounts lies a paradox: non-places are defined by their absence of place-like qualities, yet they remain profoundly influential in shaping the collective _lifeworlds_<sup><sup>[\[23\]](#endnote-23)</sup></sup> of contemporary subjectivities.

If identity, history, and relationality are markers for what constitutes a "place," then can we consider cults or nationalist movements as non-places or something else? These groups, often defined by strict adherence to particular ideologies and a shared sense of belonging, cultivate powerful emotional ties and a deep sense of identity. The fluidity of these movements, shaped by shifting allegiances and fragmented histories, challenges traditional notions of fixed, rooted places. Can these movements, built on the dynamics of collective identity, transcend the boundaries of physical place? Under the criterion of identity, history, and relationality, might these movements themselves be considered places—dynamic, relational constructs that exist outside the traditional geographical or physical realm? If we accept that non-places are not simply absences but sites of emergence, then what of people, who embody histories and relationships in ways more complex than fixed spaces ever could? If non-places destabilize conventional notions of relationality, then might _individuals_ themselves, in their layered identities, be the most profound and mutable of places? For Augé, this dilemma might create a tangle of thorns; for him the quandary signals a loss of human relationality and rootedness. For this expanded account, however, the lacunae itself become a present factor – not as a lack but as a site of potentiality.

14. The concept of “deterritorialization”, as developed in _A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia_, refers to the process by which established structures, meanings, or territories are destabilized or displaced. It signifies the breaking down of boundaries, whether physical, cultural, or conceptual, enabling new flows and connections. Often paired with reterritorialization, which involves the re-establishment of order or meaning in new contexts, deterritorialization highlights the dynamic and fluid nature of systems, identities, and spaces. _See Note 8_. [↑](#endnote-ref-14)

15. Which means, rhizomatically_._ The concept of the “rhizome,” as introduced in _A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia_, describes a non-hierarchical, decentralized, and interconnected mode of organization. Unlike the linear and rooted structure of a tree, the rhizome spreads in multiple directions, forming a network without a clear origin or endpoint. To deterritorialize rhizomatically means to challenge traditional models of knowledge, identity, and systems while simultaneously emphasize multiplicity, diversity, and lateral connections over singularity and vertical authority. _See Note 8_. [↑](#endnote-ref-15)

16. An aphorism attributed to Søren Kierkegaard, encapsulates here the paradoxical nature of human existence. While the events of life can only be fully comprehended in hindsight, life itself unfolds in the uncertainty of the present and the unknowability of the future. Kierkegaard explores this tension in _Journals and Papers_, where he reflects on the nature of temporality and existence, suggesting that understanding requires retrospection, yet action demands forward motion. This duality speaks to the existential challenge of living authentically, as one navigates the irreconcilable gap between knowing and being, past and future. See Søren Kierkegaard. _Journals and Papers_. Translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong, Indiana University Press, 1967. [↑](#endnote-ref-16)

17. _Virtualities_ refer to latent potentials or possibilities that exist within a system, awaiting actualization. In the philosophical framework of Deleuze, virtuality does not imply a lack of existence but rather denotes a realm of real potential distinct from concrete actuality. Virtualities are dynamic and generative potentials, offering a space for new configurations, forms, and connections to emerge. They underpin the transformative processes of becoming, challenging static or fixed understandings of identity, space, and systems. See Gilles Deleuze, _Difference and Repetition_, translated by Paul Patton, Columbia University Press, 1994, [↑](#endnote-ref-17)

18. This plane, as conceptualized by Deleuze (often in collaboration with Guattari), refers to a foundational, pre-conceptual field of pure potentiality and becoming. It is a realm where all entities, concepts, and events exist in a state of interconnected flux, without hierarchy or transcendence. Unlike a transcendental framework that imposes external order, the plane of immanence is self-organizing and allows for the emergence of new forms of thought and existence. It serves as a philosophical ground for understanding how ideas and phenomena are constructed without recourse to external metaphysical structures. See Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, _What Is Philosophy?_, translated by Hugh Tomlinson and Graham Burchell, Columbia University Press, 1994. [↑](#endnote-ref-18)

19. “Substance metaphysics” refers to a philosophical framework, originating in Aristotelian and Cartesian traditions, that prioritizes the concept of stable, enduring entities or “substances” as the fundamental building blocks of reality. This perspective assumes that entities have intrinsic, fixed essences that define their identity and persist through change. In contrast, critiques of substance metaphysics, such as those found in process philosophy (e.g., Whitehead) and poststructuralist thought (e.g., Deleuze), challenge this rigidity by emphasizing flux, becoming, and relationality over fixed essences. For a critique of substance metaphysics. _See Note 15_ [↑](#endnote-ref-19)

20. In Alain Badiou’s philosophy, an “_event_” is a radical occurrence that disrupts the established order of being and knowledge, opening up the possibility for new truths. Events are not part of the regular state of things. Instead, they emerge unpredictably and reconfigure the conditions of thought and action. For Badiou, fidelity to an event involves recognizing and committing to its transformative potential, often in politics, science, art, or love. Events challenge the dominance of established structures, creating room for novelty and innovation. See Alain Badiou, _Being and Event_, translated by Oliver Feltham, Continuum, 2005.

21. _Mythologies of the Heart_, as we will see, delve into the spaces between presence and absence, blurring the boundaries of fiction, philosophy, and lived experience. It explores liminality as both a metaphor and a mode of being, drawing on concepts like Marc Augé's "non-places" and Derrida's "traces" to frame the _heart_ as a site of both alienation and potentiality. I interrogate how certain societal structures erase individual presence, rendering many minoritarian groups invisible, while also reclaiming these unseen spaces as fertile grounds for revolutionary thought and emotional transformation. These "Mythologies" are not fabrications, but are cartographies of the in-between, charting paths through love, memory, and loss to help imagine novel ways of being and belonging​. [↑](#endnote-ref-21)

22. Emotion operates similarly to memory, creating constructs that shape how we perceive and interact with the world. Joy, grief, longing, or love transform the internal terrain of a person, becoming sites of profound personal significance. These emotional places are deeply tied to the Mythologies of the Heart, as they embody the narratives we tell ourselves to navigate life's uncertainties and losses. Love, in particular, becomes a "place" where we dwell—a sanctuary, a battlefield, or, what we will further in this essay, a non-place – a location that defies reductionist classification. [↑](#endnote-ref-22)

23. The term “lifeworld” (_Lebenswelt_) originates in the phenomenological philosophy of Edmund Husserl and refers to the pre-reflective, everyday world of lived experience. It encompasses the cultural, social, and historical contexts in which individuals exist and interact. Lifeworlds are the foundational, taken-for-granted structures of meaning that shape how people perceive, understand, and navigate the world. They are deeply influenced by collective traditions, linguistic frameworks, and individual subjectivity, acting as the background against which all experience occurs. This concept has been further developed in sociology by Jürgen Habermas, who contrasts the lifeworld with the systemic mechanisms of modern society, such as markets and bureaucracies. For more on the concept, see Edmund Husserl, _The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology: An Introduction to Phenomenological Philosophy_, translated by David Carr, Northwestern University Press, 1970.
