## The Politics of the Dreamable

_“What is a rebel? A man that says no.<sup><sup>[\[32\]](#endnote-32)</sup></sup>”_

This politics, then, is not mere escapism but a lived praxis — a creative and political engagement with _virtual_ possibilities – potentials that remain dormant. From this we might conjure worlds untethered from scientistic hierarchies, dualistic binaries, and instrumental apparatuses that govern the logic of the _Machine_.

_The funeral is only a few days away. It will be more than a decade since I saw many of my extended family. I knew deep inside that things were bound to go south. Things had been going well for me. Too well, in fact. So well, that it scratched the part of my brain that was a perpetual skeptic. Suspicious of good times and merry banter. My 14-year-old cousin, Caleb, was murdered in broad daylight just a week before. It was not even two weeks into the New Year. They say on the news that the suspect suffered from mental illness. As do I, but do I commit violence in a hollowing rage? They say that he had a history of violence. That this was a failure of the criminal justice system. It indeed is a failure - not of jurisprudence but of our inner humanity. He was released on his own recognizance after violently stabbing a Ring camera with a kitchen knife. Usually, when one is released on recognizance, it means they are released from custody without having to pay bail. This usually happens when the presiding judge believes the individual is not a flight risk and is likely to appear for their trial._

_This is a trustful act on the part of the legal system that the individual in question will adhere to their obligations. So, it was trust that killed Caleb. Trust is the weapon that enabled the taking of his young life. Bail reform is the key variable here. Such reform efforts often aim to reduce the reliance on cash bail, which can disproportionately affect low-income individuals who may not be able to afford the bail amount. By promoting alternatives, like Release on one’s Own Recognizance (ROR), the justice system can ensure that people are not held in jail simply because they lack financial resources. Bail reform in general seeks to create a more equitable justice system by considering factors like community ties, employment status, and prior criminal record, rather than just financial capacity._

_This practice raises concerns with repeat offenders, like the one who killed Caleb. The suspect, Waldo Mejia, has a history of violent behavior. Balancing the rights of the accused with community safety is a difficult and complex social problem, but to the families involved, it is not a complex problem at all. A life was lost - a cousin, a son, and a brother. As his blood-relative, I am unable to be unbiased, nor do I believe that such unbiased perspectives are either necessary or desirable in circumstances such as these. I know how grief can hollow a person, leaving only echoes where certainty once stood. The last week has felt like a prolonged freefall—suspended in the gut-wrenching realization that trust, the very thing that should knit a community, a society, and a nation together, has become a needling of terror. It is not lost on me that, in many ways, this is what grief does. It unravels our certainties, our assumptions, and even the stories we tell ourselves about our Mythologies of both fairness and justice._

_But as I sit here, jotting down these words just days before the service, I realize something else: the heart, like love, is built for Mythologies. It is built to endure. Caleb’s story doesn’t end in the stillness of this moment or in the courtroom debates about reform and systemic accountability. His life—the contours of who he was—exists in the spaces we’ll share here, in the fractured connections his absence has suddenly made stark._

_I’ve often found that what remains unsaid, the silences, is where the heart takes root and grows again. And maybe, just maybe, that is the purpose of gathering for a funeral — not just to mourn a loss but to start imagining again. To create a Mythology that stitches together bereavement and potentiality for something greater. It’s through these stories, these fleeting connections, that we begin to grasp the gravity of what has been stolen from us and, in some small way, honor it by moving forward. Even if, for now, forward feels impossibly far._

_…_

In essence, a politics of the dreamable foregrounds potentiality. It insists that the unformed, the liminal, and the speculative become fertile soil for collective liberation. Operating as a counterforce to systemic gridlock—economic, social, and political—it asserts that what is imaginable is also actionable. To dream is to destabilize the systems that insist on their own inevitability; it is to refuse the notion that this is all there is. In this sense, the dreamable is inherently egalitarian, giving voice to minoritarian<sup><sup>[\[33\]](#endnote-33)</sup></sup> perspectives, excluded identities, and voices at the peripheries. It dismantles the myth of a singular, immutable truth, replacing it with a Nietzschean perspectivism—a litany of viewpoints that highlight both current and potential realities. It offers the oppressed, the excluded, and the marginalized the tools to create, inhabit, and actualize Mythologies that could realize revolutionary new realities in their respective environments.

In these Mythologies, the dreamable manifests in the fragile, beautiful spaces of love, memory, and imagination. These are not idyllic musings, but supportive gestures that resist the weight of the mundane and the oppressive rationalities of systems that privilege means and ends over other forms of making sense of the world. By dreaming, one reclaims their non-places—liminal zones where the rules of the present no longer hold sway, and where new ways of being can emerge. Here, the dreamable reveals itself as the seditious force that shapes praxis: it enables the heart to remain unbroken in its defiance, art to resist commodification, and life to persist as something more than economization or survival. The politics of the dreamable, then, is not just about envisioning alternate realities; it is about operationalizing tangible spaces for the emergence of the virtual—for what has not yet been, and for what should have been—to materialize into the Real.

The transient subject moving through these non-spaces is not merely anonymized but unmoored. In this unmooring lies a chance to slip through the bindings of the Machine’s narratives of individualism, paving foundational towpaths toward micro-emancipatory<sup><sup>[\[34\]](#endnote-34)</sup></sup> efforts. These reimagined non-places subvert schemas of lacunae_<sup><sup>[\[35\]](#endnote-35)</sup></sup>_ becoming embedded in the threadings of Being itself. They shape us in ways we currently only scratch the surface of understanding. These are the nebulous realms where our possibilities wander, where our souls find solace in the potentiality of things.

Through this very politics, these non-places become the spaces between moments—the gaps in our consciousness that allow for creative emergence and collective resistance. We wear Mythologies as we might notice only a hole in a shoe when we step into a puddle. A non-place is a paradox of existence: an erotics of transgression_<sup><sup>[\[36\]](#endnote-36)</sup></sup>_ teeming with the energy of the unformed. It resists the totalizing dialectics of the Hegelians and the sterile categorizations of Scientism—refusing to be claimed, named, or fully known. It is a transient center, an explosive unfurling, a _Feminist Politics of the Body_<sup><sup>[\[37\]](#endnote-37)</sup></sup> where oppositional categories dissolve and reconfigure in an orchestral dance of impressions imperceptible to the intellect.

In these spaces, we momentarily encounter the uncanny—the familiar rendered strange, the self momentarily unmoored. Non-places unsettle our sense of permanence and our systems of spatial reference. It whispers that all things—even our deepest convictions of what is certain and true—are all but flux and flow. Yet in that very instability, they invite connection and demand growth. The absence of structure becomes a fertile ground for reimagining, for questioning the frames that confine our ways of thinking and being. In the ensuing _Affective Turn_ (we think back here to the _Linguistic_ <sup><sup>[\[38\]](#endnote-38)</sup></sup>), non-places become sites that demand the hegemony’s attention, listening not with intellect but with the very fabric of our hearts, the sensibilities of our inter-being, to the very resonances of possibility.

They are the silent witnesses to our sudden transformations, the unspoken pauses between the punctuating events of our lives. In the digital age, many of these non-places take the form of virtual realms—the endless scrolling feeds, the encroaching pixelations of the very corridors of reality, and the residue of what remains of the gravity of our interconnection. Here, too, absence mingles with presence, and meaning hovers in a suspended state, waiting for us to give form to formlessness. Non-places are not sterile or vacant; they are diffused with potentia. And within this field are, pervasively, the perspectives at the peripheries.

Minoritarians are those of us who are like free radicals. We harness our unstable energy, remaining ever vigilant, perched upon the vantage points that inhabit the precipice of thought. By the miraculous conditions of our situatedness on the horizon, we catch a glimpse of totality. We are like Deimos<sup><sup>[\[39\]](#endnote-39)</sup></sup> at the margins of a distally axial orbit -a cursory peripheral. To some, we are a rounding error. But within us are entire universes waiting to unfurl—immanent singularities_<sup><sup>[\[40\]](#endnote-40)</sup></sup>_ of perpetual becoming from which we might catch a gander, a bashful glint, of a masterpiece in-the-works. A memento—not of who we are, but of who we could be.

Beyond our embodiment, we intuitively, long before the time of the _Ancien Régime_, understood our essence to be wholly immanent. To be in the world, not of it.<sup><sup>[\[41\]](#endnote-41)</sup></sup> Slowly but surely, however, essence became subsumed by it. We became overcoded by the very systems we created. Within us, the automata implanted regimes of routinization. We unknowingly advanced the Machine’s secret concurrences, handing over the keys to legitimation. We wove ourselves into the womb of the Earth, planting seeds of exclusion. We allowed the Machine to interiorize us, adapting its schemas, surveilling.<sup><sup>[\[42\]](#endnote-42)</sup></sup> ourselves like marionettes—monkeys reaching for bananas

The Machine calculates unique numbers based on facts from our profiles. In its sterile machine, we find traces of what is left of our intrinsic worth. One number for our homes. Another for our work performance. Another for how we spend wages. Every variable of us is profiled, inspected, and subjected to "continuous improvement."<sup><sup>[\[43\]](#endnote-43)</sup></sup>. The heart would slowly become full of what was not meant for it to hold. First, it penetrates through the eyes. The intent fixates on the object of choice. Then it breathes through the ears. Quietly, it says: "We are alone, this is tranquility, there is no danger." Then, through the twisted rhetoric of the mouth, its lips meet yours. Its tongue searches frantically. Slowly, the pause: you resign, and the moment happens. It is soft and warm. You realize how tender, how idyllic, how pure the rhythm of its lips. It was like that one kiss you never quite forgot—one moment you wish had never ended, but did. A Protean paramour<sup><sup>[\[44\]](#endnote-44)</sup></sup> who speaks in your mother tongue, cooks your mother’s native food. Who sees the world through your indigenous ways of knowing. What a fine tribute, one fit for the City of Troy.<sup><sup>[\[45\]](#endnote-45)</sup></sup> _These words you’ve said... I have always wanted to hear from someone_. And once the depravity of Being infiltrates the bowel of the _Atman_<sup><sup>[\[46\]](#endnote-46)</sup></sup>, you realize that you were never what you always thought yourself to be. You were always a beginningless being. The happily ever after you always dreamt about. A nomad. An explorer. A divinity whose priceless ichor<sup><sup>[\[47\]](#endnote-47)</sup></sup> contains uncanny powers. And within it, the vestiges of incantations whose forbidden utterances empower beyond even the most heretical of rituals.

_Et Verbum caro factum est._<sup><sup>[\[48\]](#endnote-48)</sup></sup>

_Journal Entry – January 2024_

_Things have not been going well lately. But I have learned that things in this life do not come without a cost – a toll to pay. The fragments of myself that do not allow me to disremember. The slivers I have tried to cut off and burn. To set alight and leave in the pits of memory. But those parts of myself persist. They writhe and wrench in their squalor of anguish – its flesh leathery and tarnished. Its screeches full of the ghouls of my past. But it is as though I keep it caged within, anticipating despondence and agony at every turn. That, in a moment of weakness or rage, I can once more unleash wrath and rancor. That I can conjure from its bottomless furor an aegis of protection, fomenting an army fit for even the most well-endowed assailants. But then, would that not make me like them? Like Caleb’s murderer? Those whose actions themselves placed me at the peripheries? Whose gaze surveils and whose inclinations hound me like a jaguar on the prowl? Sometimes I wish it were that easy – to become a villain. To act as though your actions don’t affect anyone. To have a clear conscience despite the severity of your sins. I instead practice a ritual of perpetual atonement. I keep track of all my failings, of all my wrongs. Tallying them as if I were keeping score of a sick spectator sport. Perhaps, then, this is the cost of contentment. A perpetual doubt, a closeted suspicion of all the flux and flow of both events and people. For how can trust be broken if it was never bestowed? How can one destroy that which does not exist? So, then, I maintain my suspicions, anticipations of a dagger sheathed in a cloak._

…

But now we are far from Eden. We have devolved into a mere mortal, a sacrificial lamb. We are caught in a kind of binding, not of Issac but of fodder. An offering to the Gods for the atonement of sins we did not commit. We are continuously subject to our Technologies of the Self <sup><sup>[\[49\]](#endnote-49)</sup></sup>. Intoxicated by Attention Mechanisms<sup><sup>[\[50\]](#endnote-50)</sup></sup> we created. Controlled by Strategies of Stratification we developed. Through the Corporate Monopolization of Spaces we allowed. With our Registers of Certification. Our Claims to Legitimacy. The _heart_, then, much like a non-place, then, exists as an enigma—a locus of feeling, memory, and connection. And at its best, it is often profoundly untethered from the rigid systems that govern our lives. It is like a perpetual Mythology, a story we tell ourselves about what love and belonging mean. Our means and the ends that justify them. _Mythologies_ are the myths we embed into reality, the compasses we use to navigate ineffable realms; they are the scaffolding that holds up the most intimate desires and the basest of fears, even as they dissolve in the face of lived reality. In the same way that a non-place refuses to be defined by permanence, the _heart_ also resists both fixity and closure.

Love, in its most transcendent and fragile forms, does not reside in the spaces we can easily name or inhabit. It thrives in the liminal — the space before the gesture (deliberations of intimacy, a premonition of coyness, a shy smile to yourself) and the space after its consummation (the butterflies, the endorphin rush, the laughing at jokes told many hours ago you continue to chuckle at), the space where the gaze touches its object but where they do not meet. It is a shadow of a shadow, a soundless echo, not a glimmer of light but a flicker of darkness glimpsed from the peripheries of one’s vision. It exists not as an object but as a dormancy, embedded with the power to transform. The power to create. The power to abandon. The power to destroy.

Yet, the _Mythologies_ are not merely inventions or fabrications. They are truths clothed in layers of metaphor and simile – because many truths like the _Mythologies_ we cannot, do not, or sometimes should not, articulate,<sup><sup>[\[51\]](#endnote-51)</sup></sup> but that we might bear through each dusking of the sun. They are the love letters we never sent, all the sights and scenes we never had a chance to behold, the apologies we never uttered, the dreams we dared to hold before time whittled them into granules of dust. The interiority of the interior. Mythologies help to shape us as much as the tangible experiences of our lives. Mythologies are the days we recount in the quiet hours, the stories we tell ourselves about our worth in the world, the spaces we return to in moments of solitude, the wounded soldiers we carry home in spite of the impossible odds, the imaginings that give color to an otherwise absurd, cosmic existence. If a non-place is marked by fluidity and absence, the _heart itself_, then, becomes a kind of non-place — a sanctuary and a prison all at once. A site of both incalculable connection and complete alienation.<sup><sup>[\[52\]](#endnote-52)</sup></sup>

_Journal Entry – Jan 10<sup>th</sup>, 2025_

_Today, I am looking to get my car inspected, and I don’t know how I’ll pay for it. One of the headlights is finicky, and the window washer fluid doesn’t work even though the reservoir is full. I haven’t gotten paid yet, and my credit cards are almost maxed out. The heat doesn’t work either; it only blasts frigid air, so I keep the vents closed and the air pressure at zero. I usually drive with mittens on, dressed to the hilt, layered in cotton and wool as if I habitually ventured near the poles of the Earth._

_On my way to Dunkin, I spotted a Porsche. It had yellow brake calipers and onyx black rims. It was painted in a fashionable aquamarine. The oceanic blue of the skies. Some of us are merely trying to survive, I thought to myself. Others, apparently, are thriving. Flourishing, even. But are these not merely appearances that display themselves upon the surface? The very tip of the proverbial iceberg? My credit is still being built, and I live with a roommate, but I still visit my parents on the weekends when I can. My mother prepared rigatoni lasagna the other day, but with a Latin twist. In the meat sauce, hints of Sazon and cilantro abounded. The flavors were a medley of Goya and Rao’s._

_The result was divine – I could have very well gone for a second, or even a third serving. I notice that she moves around the kitchen a tad gingerly. I also discern that she cooks less often these days. Her arthritis frequently flares up. I offer to help, even if it’s the simplest tasks – dicing vegetables or boiling the pasta – but even then, she often refuses assistance. Over the years, the kitchen has become her sanctuary, and she is a master at work. I merely sit myself at the kitchen counter, observing her movements, studying her techniques and, most importantly, keeping her company. I had some help last month from my father with the car note. I had been in between jobs and used him as a last resort._

_It was embarrassing, approaching him for help. But in his usual charitable manner, he was practically happy, honored, even, to come to my aid. It is in these moments that I realize how blessed many of us are despite the trouncing weights of the world. I may not have heat in my car, but at least I have one. I may not have stellar credit, but how do I feel day-to-day? Is life - not a destination - but a journey? Admittedly, there are many times where I fret about, ruminating about my many commitments and entanglements. Other times I flounder, like a fish out of water – completely out of their element and disturbed by the alien and uncongenial environment that is adulthood. I am like a moth fluttering in the wind, aimlessly undecided on even the next instant. Unsure of what the next day, week, or month has in store._

_But more often than not, I am absorbed in the things that I love – reading, writing, solitude, and genuine connection with others. This reminds me of Nietzsche, and his mentioning of a love of fate. An amor fati of the cards that have been dealt to us. Is this not enough for what constitutes The Good Life? Occupying a space in the world you desire to inhabit, and not escape from? Dwelling in a body that you feel comfortable in, despite its unattractive contours? Inhabiting a mind that you have befriended in the face of its many irrationalities? Its conflicting absurdities? The acceptance of the consequences from its many naïve acts and deeds? I often ruminate on questions like these, usually in the quiet hours of the evening. The stillness of the night has a way of amplifying reflection._

_It is in these moments that I wrestle with my many ambitions, my many fears, and my many hopes. At times, the weight of uncertainty feels unbearable, but it is this very uncertainty that reveals fleeting glimpses of beauty – a mother’s quiet resilience, a father’s unconditional support, the meditative simplicity of pen on paper. The Good Life, to me, isn’t found in grandiose achievements or buttressed stability, but in the acceptance of life’s temerity - its impermanence and continual unfolding. The embracing of its small victories, and its seemingly trivial triumphs. It is in the ability to love what is, with all its flaws and treasured blemishes, that inspires me to continue sauntering forward, one uncertain and doubtful step at a time._

31. Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of _polyvocality_, introduced in his analysis of the novel in _The Dialogic Imagination_, refers to the coexistence and interaction of multiple voices or perspectives within a text. Rather than a singular, dominant voice, Bakhtin argues that polyvocality represents the interplay of various viewpoints, each with its own legitimacy, which challenges the idea of a unified, authoritative narrative. This idea of multiple, competing voices has been applied not only to literature but also to broader social and cultural contexts, emphasizing the complexity and diversity of discourse in shaping meaning. See Bakhtin, Mikhail. _The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays_. Edited by Michael Holquist, translated by Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist, University of Texas Press, 1981. [↑](#endnote-ref-31)

32. In this context, rebellion is not merely an opposition to authority or tradition, but a personal and existential stance against the status quo, asserting one's autonomy and individuality in the face of oppressive forces. Camus suggests that to rebel is to reject imposed meaning and the totalizing narratives of society, opting instead to affirm one’s own subjective truth. This rebellious act becomes a declaration of the will to create alternative realities, a central idea in the _Politics of the Dreamable_, where dreaming and imagining new possibilities serve as acts of resistance. See Camus, Albert. The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt. Translated by Anthony Bower, Vintage Books, 1991. [↑](#endnote-ref-32)

33. _Becoming Minoritarian_ refers to the process of identifying with and embracing the experiences, perspectives, and practices of those who are marginalized or excluded within dominant social, political, and cultural structures. It is a concept rooted in the work of philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, who argue that the minority is not a static, oppressed group, but a dynamic force capable of subverting and reshaping societal norms. By "becoming minoritarian," one aligns with the potential for difference and resistance, challenging hegemonic power structures through the embrace of multiplicity and alternative modes of existence. See Deleuze and Guattari, _A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia_ [↑](#endnote-ref-33)

34. _Micro-emancipation_ refers to small-scale, localized actions or practices that challenge dominant power structures and norms, often at the individual or community level. These efforts focus on creating moments of resistance that, while not necessarily revolutionary on a grand scale, contribute to the broader process of social transformation by empowering marginalized or oppressed groups. Micro-emancipation is often seen as a way to subvert systemic inequalities through everyday actions, choices, or interactions that challenge and destabilize the status quo. _See Perret, Véronique_ "_Macro-Emancipation, Micro-Emancipation_." _Organization Development and Society_, vol. 20, no. 1, 2012. [↑](#endnote-ref-34)

35. &nbsp;This gaze, in the context of _the_ _schemas of lacunae_, functions as both a tool of presence and a harbinger of absence. It draws attention to gaps, highlighting what is unseen or missing, yet by doing so, it transforms absence into a form of presence. This dynamic aligns with Lacanian psychoanalysis, where the gaze reveals the subject's inability to fully grasp _the Other_ or _the Real_, exposing a void at the core of perception. In perceiving a lacuna, the act of gazing becomes a way of inhabiting the absence—making the unseen or undefined momentarily visible, not as a thing in itself, but as a disruption or aperture. Furthermore, the gaze often carries power, dictating what absences are acknowledged or ignored. This power may silence marginalized voices, rendering them invisible, or conversely, reclaim their presence by gazing back, as a form of resistance. In this duality, the gaze in schemas of lacunae does not just observe but shapes and reshapes the meaning of absence, creating fertile spaces for questioning, interpretation, and reimagination. [↑](#endnote-ref-35)

36. The "_erotics of transgression_" refers to the alluring yet destabilizing pull of crossing boundaries—whether they are social, moral, emotional, or conceptual. This concept engages with the interplay between desire and prohibition, where the act of defiance against established norms generates a profound sense of both liberation and vulnerability. Drawing from Bataille’s notion of eroticism as the disruption of discontinuity, transgression becomes a liminal act that unites opposites: the sacred and the profane, presence and absence, creation and destruction.

    Within the schemas of lacunae, the _erotics of transgression_ is intricately linked to the act of engaging with the void, the unseen, or the forbidden. The absence itself becomes charged with seductive potential, inviting inquiry, reimagination, or even maniacal obsession. This dynamic positions the lacuna not merely as a passive void but as an active site of tension and possibility, where the boundaries of meaning and experience are both tested and expanded. By inhabiting this space of transgression, one confronts the unspoken and the unspeakable, embracing the creative and transformative potential of what lies beyond the limits of the familiar. See Bataille, Georges. _Eroticism_. Translated by Mary Dalwood, City Lights Books, 1986. [↑](#endnote-ref-36)

37. The _Feminist Politics of the Body_ examines how societal norms and power structures shape and control women's bodies, advocating for autonomy and challenging objectification. This perspective is explored in various feminist texts, including Susan Bordo's "Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body," which analyzes cultural representations of the female body. See Bordo, Susan. _Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body_. University of California Press, 1993. [↑](#endnote-ref-37)

38. In his work on _The_ _Linguistic Turn_, Richard Rorty argues that philosophy’s focus on language, rather than on metaphysical or epistemological concerns, represents a crucial shift in understanding human experience and knowledge. This turn emphasizes that our understanding of the world is mediated through language, and that linguistic structures shape how we construct meaning. In contrast, this book proposes an _Affective_ _Turn_, which shifts the focus from linguistic structures to the subjectivity of individual experience, emphasizing the role of personal perception, emotions, and embodied experience in constructing reality. By emphasizing the experience of Affect, we argue for a more nuanced understanding of how knowledge is produced and how individuals engage with the world in ways that are shaped by their unique perspectives and contexts. See Rorty, Richard. _The Linguistic Turn: Recent Essays in Philosophical Method_. University of Chicago Press, 1967 [↑](#endnote-ref-38)

39. In Greek mythology, Deimos, whose name translates to "dread" or "terror," is the personification of fear and panic, often depicted alongside his twin brother Phobos ("fear") as companions to Ares, the god of war. Deimos symbolizes the inner turmoil and anxiety that precede or accompany conflict, serving as a reminder of the psychological dimensions of struggle. When invoked in the context of schemas of lacunae, Deimos represents the unsettling awareness of absence or the dread of confronting the unknown within those gaps. Just as Deimos orbits Ares as an inescapable shadow of war, the emotional resonance of lacunae or the recognition of voids often carries a similar sense of foreboding or tension. This connection frames absence not simply as lack, but as a charged and evocative force that shapes how individuals navigate uncertainty and transformation. [↑](#endnote-ref-39)

40. "Immanent singularities" refer to unique, self-contained entities or events that arise within and are entirely constituted by a given system or framework, without reliance on external or transcendent forces. Rooted in Deleuzian philosophy, these singularities emphasize the dynamic and interconnected nature of reality, where change and becoming emerge from within the system's inherent potentialities rather than being imposed from outside. In the context of lacunae, immanent singularities denote the transformative potential latent within gaps or absences. These voids are not merely empty spaces but sites of intense generative capacity, where new meanings, identities, or forms can emerge. By focusing on immanence, this perspective shifts attention from external resolutions to the internal dynamism of absence, highlighting how lacunae themselves can foster creativity, reimagination, and resistance to closure or fixity. The concept underscores the radical potential for self-organizing, emergent possibilities within the very fabric of perceived absence. _See Note 15._ [↑](#endnote-ref-40)

41. This phrase is often associated with Christian theology, particularly with the teachings of Jesus in the Gospel of John. In John 17:14-16, Jesus speaks to God about his followers, saying they are not of the world, even though they live within it. This distinction reflects a spiritual understanding of human existence, where individuals are seen as engaged in the world but not fully defined by its material or temporal concerns. It suggests that while humans exist within the world, their essence transcends worldly systems and should not be controlled or defined by them. See _The Holy Bible, New Revised Standard Version_, John 17:14-16. [↑](#endnote-ref-41)

42. The concept of the _disciplinary society_ is central to Michel Foucault’s analysis in _Discipline and Punish_, where he describes how power operates through institutions and practices that enforce surveillance, normalization, and control. In these societies, individuals are constantly monitored and regulated within structured environments like schools, hospitals, and prisons. Foucault’s notion of the _disciplinary society_ is later extended by Gilles Deleuze in his essay "Postscript on the Societies of Control," where he argues that modern societies are transitioning from disciplinary institutions to _societies of control_. In _societies of control_, the mechanisms of power are more diffuse and fluid, moving beyond enclosed institutions to permeate every aspect of life, constantly shaping individuals through technologies, media, and networks. Deleuze suggests that in this shift, control becomes more continuous and pervasive, creating new forms of surveillance and manipulation that operate through more decentralized and less visible means than the rigid disciplinary structures of the past See Foucault, Michel. _Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison_. Translated by Alan Sheridan, Pantheon Books, 1977 and Deleuze, Gilles. “Postscript on the Societies of Control.” _October_, vol. 59, 1992. [↑](#endnote-ref-42)

43. Often referred to as _Kaizen_ in the context of the Toyota Production System) _continuous improvement_ is a key principle of lean manufacturing, focusing on the incremental and ongoing enhancement of processes, products, and performance. This philosophy emphasizes that small, continuous improvements—often made by those directly involved in the process—can lead to significant long-term gains in efficiency, quality, and overall performance. From a critical theory perspective, _continuous improvement_ (or _Kaizen_) within the Toyota Production System is not merely a process of operational refinement but a mechanism of control and discipline embedded within the structures of labor and production. This principle, often celebrated for fostering efficiency and quality, can be seen as a way to perpetuate the status quo by pushing workers to engage in endless self-optimization under the guise of participation. While framed as a collaborative process, _continuous improvement_ in this context reflects a system where labor is normalized and redefined in terms of productivity, subjecting workers to a perpetual cycle of performance enhancement. In the broader capitalist context, it becomes a tool for maintaining the dominance of management by diffusing the responsibility for improvement across the workforce, ensuring the system's reproduction while masking its exploitative nature. See Monden, Yasuhiro. _Toyota Production System: An Integrated Approach to Just-In-Time_. 4th ed., CRC Press, 2012 [↑](#endnote-ref-43)

44. We evoke the mythological figure of Proteus, a shape-shifting god from the universe of Greek mythology, symbolizing constant change and adaptability. The Protean paramour in this context suggests a lover who is multifaceted and ever-changing, one who embodies various roles and identities, constantly evolving and adapting to the needs of the moment. This dynamic, fluid nature of love creates an intimate connection that mirrors the shifting tides of desire and emotional depth. [↑](#endnote-ref-44)

45. This sentiment ties to the cunning and treachery of the Trojan Horse, an iconic symbol from the myth of the fall of Troy. This tribute, then, refers to something deceptively grand, much like the horse itself—an offering that, under its surface of magnificence, harbors a hidden, subversive purpose. The comparison underscores the idea of a seemingly innocent or noble gesture that conceals an underlying force capable of bringing about a profound and irreversible change, much like the infiltration of Troy by the Greeks through the Horse. See Virgil. _The Aeneid_. Translated by Robert Fagles, Penguin Classics, 2006. [↑](#endnote-ref-45)

46. _Atman_ is a key concept in Hindu philosophy, particularly within the Advaita Vedanta tradition, representing the true self or soul. It is considered the innermost essence of an individual, transcending the ego and physical body. In this context, _Atman_ is often equated with Brahman, the universal consciousness or divine reality, suggesting that the true self is not separate from the cosmos but an integral part of the eternal, unchanging essence.

47. In Greek mythology, ichor is the ethereal, golden fluid that flows through the veins of gods and immortals, often described as a divine counterpart to human blood. It symbolizes the essence of divinity, embodying power, vitality, and transcendence. Unlike mortal blood, ichor is not subject to decay or corruption, reinforcing its association with immortality and purity. In metaphorical contexts, ichor often represents the elusive or sublime qualities that elevate an entity or experience beyond the ordinary. When linked to perceptions of lacunae, ichor serves as a poetic image of the transformative potential inherent in absence or voids—an otherworldly substance that infuses the unseen or undefined with divine vitality, foregrounding absence into a site of creative emergence and profound significance.

48. “And the word became flesh” is a pivotal moment in Christian theology found in the Gospel of John (1:14), referring to the incarnation of Christ (the anointed one). In this context, the phrase is employed metaphorically to evoke the transformation of the divine or ideal into something material, tangible, and subject to the world’s limitations. Here, it signifies the movement from the transcendental or abstract — represented by the idealized, mythical, or spiritual self—to the harsh, embodied reality of human existence, emphasizing the loss of Edenic innocence and the fall into mortal constraints. The invocation of this phrase highlights the shift from an abstract, unbounded existence to the fragmented, corporeal state of being, underscoring the tension between divine potential and earthly sacrifice. See _The Holy Bible_, _New Revised Standard Version_, John 1:14. [↑](#endnote-ref-48)

50. Attention mechanisms, while originally a concept in artificial intelligence, have profound implications for understanding how social media algorithms capture and exploit human focus. In AI, attention mechanisms allow models to prioritize specific parts of input data, such as words or images, enabling nuanced interpretation and decision-making. In social media, these principles are adapted to dynamically predict and maximize user engagement. Algorithms identify patterns in user behavior to serve content that is most likely to captivate attention—whether through sensationalism, emotional triggers, or confirmation of biases.

    This process turns human attention into a commodity, perpetually fragmented and redirected by an ecosystem optimized for monetization. Social media platforms weaponize these mechanisms to create addictive feedback loops, where notifications, recommendations, and infinite scrolling keep users engaged far longer than intended. Within the context of schemas of lacunae, these mechanisms amplify the feeling of absence, leveraging the fear of missing out (FOMO) or dissatisfaction with the present moment to sustain continuous engagement. Thus, attention mechanisms not only steal our focus but also shape our emotional and cognitive landscapes, often leaving users disoriented in the liminal spaces between digital presence and personal fulfillment.

51. _Infra_ 37; The power of language – the statement “fuck you, mom”, is an abomination of words and a profane arrangement of signs and signifiers that I fully reject from the very the essence of my soul. [↑](#endnote-ref-51)

52. For clarity, what this explores here is the paradoxical nature of love and human experience, suggesting that love transcends tangible spaces and resides in the liminal, the undefined in-between spaces where meaning is not easily grasped. This liminality is described as a shadow, an echo, a fleeting moment that defies articulation but possesses immense power—capable of transformation, creation, abandonment, and destruction. The paradox is heightened by the concept of _Mythologies_. These fictions, such as unexpressed love letters, missed opportunities, and unspoken apologies, shape our lives as much as our concrete experiences. The heart, described as both sanctuary and prison, then, becomes a _non-place_, an ambiguous space where both potentials for connection and alienation coexist, underscoring the tension between presence and absence, between what is felt but not easily named or lived.
