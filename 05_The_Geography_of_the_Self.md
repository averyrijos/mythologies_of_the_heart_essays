## The Geography of the Self

Every individual bears within them the residual imprints of relationships, moments, and decisions that have shaped their being Just as a place retains its history in its stones, ruins, or atmosphere, people carry their histories in their bodies, minds, and emotional landscapes. In our view, a _place_ is not merely defined by its physical boundaries or its material terrain but by the potential relationships it fosters. In this sense, the parks we frequent, marketplaces where we shop and mingle, and the homes and refuges we share and invite others into are, of course, places. These are significant places because they are spaces of exponential interconnection and relationality, even with the space’s functional purposivism.

But just as places are defined by their cultural and historical narratives, _people_ are shaped by their personal histories and identities. Each individual carries within them sedimented layers of experiences, memories, and relationalities that create a unique _geography of the self_ <sup><sup>[\[24\]](#endnote-24)</sup></sup>. Consider the notion that a place can hold the imprint of both events and occurrences. Similarly, individuals act as repositories of their lived experiences, becoming dynamic spaces where past and present intersect. In this sense, people are not static entities but evolving sites of narrative, place, and identity.

So, in a similar vein, people _themselves_ function as places. They are terrains to explore, mountains to climb, and complex ecosystems to engage with. Relationships, whether familial, romantic, professional, or social, unfold through individuals and groups, forming intricate, navigable landscapes. To truly know someone is to step into their inner sanctum, to traverse the continuities and ruptures within their emotional and psychological landscapes. These are sceneries painted with the brushstrokes of treasured memories, profound fears, and towering aspirations, each elementality contributing to the depth and fluidity of the person’s internal geography.<sup><sup>[\[25\]](#endnote-25)</sup></sup>

Memory itself, as a foundational element of personhood, functions as a map for the internal geography of the self. Just as physical places are imbued with history, memories hold the _traces_ of lived experiences. They are spaces within us where past events are reconstructed and re-experienced. For instance, a childhood home may no longer physically exist, but within the individual's memory, it remains a vivid, navigable space—a place as real as any “real” externalized environment.

Emotions operate similarly, creating constructs that shape how we perceive and interact with the world. Joy, grief, longing, or love transform the internal terrain of a person, becoming sites of profound personal significance. These emotional places are deeply tied to the _Mythologies of the Heart_, as they embody the narratives we hold onto to navigate life's uncertainties and losses. Love, in particular, becomes a "place" where we dwell—a sanctuary, a battlefield, or, what we will further in this book, a _non-place_ – a location of interest that defies simple categorization​.

Just as we inhabit our internal spaces incessantly, we also dwell within the places constituted by others. Relationships often involve entering the emotional and narrative spaces of another person—learning their histories, navigating their memories, and sharing their dreams. This mutual cohabitation highlights the amalgamation of distinct human lifeworlds, where each person is both a host of their own world and a visitor within the worlds of others.

In the context of the _Mythologies_, this mutually sustaining process is central to the dynamics it reveals. Love, loss, and longing are not solitary experiences but shared journeys through the landscapes of each other's hearts. These shared places become the Mythologies we co-create, the maps we follow, and the sanctuaries we return to, even as they remain incomplete or logically imperfect. In _Mythologies_ these centers become vital to the narratives we construct to endure and make sense of our existence. How we rationalize grief, and how we move forward from the kiss of bittersweet ends.

The "heart," as a center, holds a collection of memories, emotions, and connections—each palimpsestic layer upon the other, forming a living map of our personal and relational histories. These _Mythologies_ are the narratives we tell ourselves about who we are, who we love, where we come from, and where we aspire to go. They can be both illusions and truths, as well as both illusory _and_ true simultaneously, offering comfort and clarity even as they obscure the messiness and noise of reality.

A person here might construct a narrative around a lost love, idealizing the relationship as a perfect sanctuary. This _Mythology_, in turn, becomes a place they return to in moments of solitude, not as a literal memory but as a reconstructed emotional space. It is here that the heart's _Mythologies_ overlap with the concept of non-places: these spaces are temporary, are found in transition, and often defined more by absence than presence, yet they are crucial to how embodied subjects navigate their memories, lives, and aspirations.

The constitutive elements of people - memories, emotions, relationships – then, are revealed as dynamic places that mirror the paradoxes of non-places. They are transient yet permanent, absent yet present, fixed yet fluid. These internal places, tied to the _Mythologies of the Heart_, are not just constructs of survival but powerful sites of potential for the imagination. They remind us that to be human is to inhabit a complex terrain of the self, to dwell in the spaces between what is and what could be, and to find meaning in the _Mythologies_ that sustain us.

The gaps in continuity described, then, are not sterile voids but living spaces where new combinations of thought, identity, and subjectivity can emerge. This reframing aligns with certain phenomenological<sup><sup>[\[26\]](#endnote-26)</sup></sup> strains that explore absence as an active and generative force. <sup><sup>[\[27\]](#endnote-27)</sup></sup> Absence becomes a condition of possibility for new ways of being, a notion that resonates deeply with contemporary critiques of ontological and epistemic conceptions of fixity and closure – and all their various forms.<sup><sup>[\[28\]](#endnote-28)</sup></sup>

_Closure_ is not merely the conclusion of an event or a narrative; it is, more significantly, a premature termination of possibility. It forecloses the potential for future experiences, shutting off the pathways through which alternative futures, dreams, and realities might emerge. Closure creates the illusion of finality, sealing off the unspoken, the unexplored, and the unresolved, leaving a world reduced in scope and richness. _Fixity_, similarly, represents an unyielding adherence to a particular state of being—a refusal to embrace the natural dynamism and fluidity of existence. It is the cementing of identity, thought, and feeling into rigid, immutable forms that resist the flux of life, denying the multiplicity and unpredictability that define human experience.

Within the exploration of the heart and its myriad spaces, a resistance to closure and fixity is not just important but essential. The _Mythologies of the Heart_, as both a concept and mode of being, thrives in openness and fluidity - in its capacity to remain porous to the world’s ambiguities and contradictions. To resist closure is to keep alive the potential for growth, transformation, and reinterpretation. It is to allow our experiences, no matter how seemingly final, to remain open-ended, capable of being revisited and reimagined. Likewise, opposing fixity enables us to acknowledge and embrace the multiplicity of our inter-being—the profound interconnectedness that reveals we are not static entities but ever-changing assemblages. Ever-becoming processes.

I have had many cherished, deeply meaningful relationships that I once believed would last a lifetime. Yet, they were marked by abrupt closures, sudden ruptures that left behind an aching sense of discontinuity. These moments, while often painful, altered not only the way I perceived the world but also how I moved through it, interacted with it, and imagined my place within it. In hindsight, I see that the closures I perceived were, perhaps, illusions—constructs born out of a mistaken instinct for self-preservation. By withdrawing, by mentally and emotionally closing myself off to the ongoing dialogue between the world and my heart, I denied myself encounters that might have been rich with love, community, and hope. What did I fear? Perhaps it was the pain of losing yet another cherished connection, the unbearable weight of beginning anew. Yet, as I reflect now, I see that the very act of closing off was itself the most profound loss.

This interplay between closure and fixity mirrors the contradictions inherent in the human condition. On the one hand, we crave stability and certainty—a framework within which to make sense of our experiences and define ourselves. On the other hand, we yearn for freedom, for the possibility of wandering through uncharted territories of the heart and mind, unencumbered by the weight of what has been. These competing desires ultimately create a tension that defines much of human life.

In this tension, Mythologies become vital conceptual personae, offering a way to navigate the space between closure and fluidity, between fixity and openness. Mythologies, far from being escapist fabrications, are imaginative constructs through which we process the complexities of existence. They do not necessarily transcend or oppose closure and fixity but affirm their presence while simultaneously offering alternative arrangements. Through Mythologies, we find the tools to hold space for the unknown, to see that closure and fluidity can coexist as commingling chapters of the same story.

By maintaining an openness to the fluidity of our narratives, we honor the intricate and often contradictory nature of our emotions and memories. This openness allows us to reconcile with the past, to heal from its wounds, and to discover new paths forward even in the face of loss and change. It teaches us that even within finality, there exists the seeds of possibility—an open invitation to reimagine what was thought to be closed and to embrace the unknown as a fertile ground for new beginnings. In rejecting the rigidity of closure and fixity, we do not abandon the past but transform it into a dynamic element of our ongoing becoming. This is the paradox of the heart: it is both sanctuary and frontier, a space where the finite and the infinite meet in perpetual interplay.

In this way, _Mythologies_ do not merely reflect our lived experiences but actively shape them, inviting us to engage with the full spectrum of our humanity and to find meaning in the spaces between. The memory of a lost loved one, for instance, might initially feel like a source of pain, but over time their memory can transform into a memento of pride or strength, guiding future actions or planting the seeds for inspiring insights ones may have for the future. This transformation illustrates how internal places, much like external ones, can be sites of both preservation and reinvention, accenting the paradoxical nature of non-places. In this reimagining, non-places are imbued with a "_Politics of the Dreamable_ <sup><sup>[\[29\]](#endnote-29)</sup></sup>" – the affirmative interpretation of Augé's more detached introspections. If Augé sees highways and airports as zones where human significance evaporates, this account reads them as liminal thresholds, where meaning can reassemble in nonlinear, emergent, and self-organizing<sup><sup>[\[30\]](#endnote-30)</sup></sup> configurations. This _politics_ more plainly refers to the radical potential embedded within the mind's eye — the ability to envision alternate futures, to coexist with conflicting voices<sup><sup>[\[31\]](#endnote-31)</sup></sup>, and to challenge the _Machine_ by reasserting possibilities where there appears to be none. In a world increasingly defined by rationality, technology, and scientism, _dreaming itself_ becomes an act of resistance. It defies the constraints of what is often presented as "realistic" or "inevitable" by those who maintain control, inviting us to reject the totalizing narratives of permanence and inevitability.

24. These geographies parallel the shaping of physical places with the formation of personal identity. Just as landscapes are formed by natural forces and historical events, the self is shaped by an accretion of sense-experiences, relationships, and memories, creating a unique and dynamic internal terrain. This notion views identity as a process of becoming, marked by the residual imprints of pivotal events and interactions. Like how battlefields bear scars of war or sacred sites resonate with devotion, individuals carry within them traces of their histories. The "geography of the self" positions identity as a relational and evolving construct, shaped by the interplay of personal and collective narratives, and by the fluid interaction between the past and present.

25. Internal geography, more technically, refers to _ontological situatedness_. This refers to the condition of being embedded within a specific context of existence, shaped by the interplay of one's identity, environment, and relational structures. It acknowledges that our understanding of self and reality is not fixed but emerges through the dynamic interaction of historical, cultural, and phenomenological factors. This concept draws on Heidegger’s _Being-in-the-World_ (_Dasein_), emphasizing that our existence is always "thrown" into a pre-existing world of meaning and constraints. Heidegger describes this in _Being and Time_ as the fundamental structure of human existence (_Sein und Zeit_, 1927). Situatedness frames our ontological experience as inherently contingent, urging a recognition of how power, positionality, and the limits of perspective shape the possibilities of understanding and action within the world. See Martin Heidegger, _Being and Time_. Translated by John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson, Harper Perennial Modern Thought, 2008. [↑](#endnote-ref-25)

26. The term "phenomenological" refers to a philosophical approach that emphasizes the study of conscious experiences from the first-person perspective. It involves examining the structures of experience and consciousness to understand how we perceive and interpret the world around us. This approach is often associated with the works of philosophers like Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger [↑](#endnote-ref-26)

27. Merleau-Ponty explores the idea of absence as a generative force versus perception and existence. Merleau-Ponty challenges traditional notions of presence and absence, proposing that absence is not merely a void but an essential aspect of the perceptual world, allowing for the emergence of new ways of being and understanding. In this work, he discusses how absence, or the invisible, plays a key role in the experience of the visible and in the formation of meaning. This aligns with phenomenological perspectives that regard absence as an active space for potentiality, shaping the contours of identity, thought, and collective experience. See Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. _The Visible and the Invisible_. Translated by Alphonso Lingis, Northwestern University Press, 1968 [↑](#endnote-ref-27)

28. The dynamic interplay between closure and fixity mirrors contradictions inherent to the human condition. On one hand, we seek stability and certainty to make sense of our lives; on the other, we yearn for the freedom to explore uncharted territories of our hearts and minds. Mythologies, therefore, become vitally essential personae through which we navigate these tensions, offering spaces where the rigidity of closure and fixity can be transcended. By maintaining an openness to the fluidity of our narratives, we honor the complexities of our emotions and memories. We allow for the possibility of reconciliation, healing, and discovery, even in the face of loss and change [↑](#endnote-ref-28)

29. This _Politics_ refers to the radical potential inherent in the act of dreaming and envisioning alternate futures, presenting dreaming as an act of resistance against the constraints of the present reality. This concept challenges the accepted narratives of what is deemed realistic or inevitable, offering a space for reimagining the world beyond current systems of power, rationality, and hierarchy. It is not an escape but a deliberate engagement with possibility, particularly in non-places — those liminal, transient zones where meaning can be reformed in nonlinear, emergent ways. The politics of the dreamable foreground speculative thinking as fertile ground for collective liberation, enabling marginalized voices to shape new realities that defy systemic inertia and totalizing narratives. It asserts that through dreaming, one can reclaim spaces where the conventional rules no longer apply, making room for new modes of being and revolutionary change. [↑](#endnote-ref-29)

30. Self-organization (or _autopoiesis_) refers to a system's ability to maintain and reproduce itself through its own internal processes, without external direction or control. This concept, developed by biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, emphasizes how their capacity to autonomously create and regulate their own structures and functions characterizes living systems. In the context of the _Politics of the Dreamable_, self-organizing assemblages highlight the potential for meaning and order to emerge spontaneously and non-hierarchically, challenging the deterministic frameworks imposed by external authorities. Rather than relying on preordained structures, self-organizing systems enable the dynamic, emergent formation of new possibilities, much like the radical reimagining of the future through dreaming. See Maturana, Humberto R., and Francisco J. Varela. _Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living._ D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1980. [↑](#endnote-ref-30)

31. Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of _polyvocality_, introduced in his analysis of the novel in _The Dialogic Imagination_, refers to the coexistence and interaction of multiple voices or perspectives within a text. Rather than a singular, dominant voice, Bakhtin argues that polyvocality represents the interplay of various viewpoints, each with its own legitimacy, which challenges the idea of a unified, authoritative narrative. This idea of multiple, competing voices has been applied not only to literature but also to broader social and cultural contexts, emphasizing the complexity and diversity of discourse in shaping meaning. See Bakhtin, Mikhail. _The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays_. Edited by Michael Holquist, translated by Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist, University of Texas Press, 1981. [↑](#endnote-ref-31)
