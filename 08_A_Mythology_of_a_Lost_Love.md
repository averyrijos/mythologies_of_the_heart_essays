## A Mythology of a Lost Love

This same refusal to render the unseen visible reverberates in a Mythology – a letter - I will share with you, dear reader, in solidarity. I shall demonstrate not merely an abstract or theoretical speculation, but a reflection on a deeply personal voyage. One that feels, in its own way, oddly relevant to this exploration of ours. It’s a portrait of what was left unsaid, of emotions and truths that remained hidden, suspended in the silence between two people who once shared a life. It is a testament to how the unseen — the unspoken, the unfelt, the unacknowledged — can persist, shaping us in ways we have barely begun to comprehend.

What follows is not just a story, but a letter I never sent to Her. It is an attempt to articulate the knot of emotions I carried long after we parted ways. A splaying of the viscera, the Mythologies of my Heart. It is a memento of absence, a remembrance of the spaces of us that remain hollowed in the aftermath of loss and change, and of the strange powers those voids can hold over us. Though it was meant for Her, it remained unspoken for far too long, confined to the dustbins of memory. In sharing it now, I hope that it might serve as a bridge between what was hidden and what can finally be brought to light. In the words of a great artist-philosopher:

>_“(…) And if it is true, as Nietzsche claims, that a philosopher, to deserve our respect, must preach by example, you can appreciate the importance of that reply, for it \[that reply\] will precede the definitive act. These are facts the heart can feel; yet they call for careful study before they become clear to the intellect.”<sup><sup>[\[71\]](#endnote-71)</sup></sup>_

This letter is my way of confronting what I could not confront then — a way of giving shape to what remained shapeless, of offering words to what was left unsaid. It is, perhaps, my own small act of reclamation, a way of honoring the unseen and the neglected, for all it continues to sustain.

_Victoria.,_

_We were together for three wonderful, jubilant years. Many times, I would stop and think to myself how you would be such an amazing mother. Your attentiveness is hawk-eyed. You can read the room before anyone else has a chance to speak. The pain of others sends “cold spiders of panic crawling down your spine”<sup><sup>[\[72\]](#endnote-72)</sup></sup>; I sensed your uncanny faculties early on in time together. You always had a very keen impression of what I was feeling, even before I realized something was amiss. At times, you would even discern the subtle traces of inner sensibilities that would take me many moons to unsnarl. The premonitions would viscously bubble towards the meridian of my conscience, knotted like a barb of thorns. It took letting you go to recall once more how they sting, those familiar pangs of grief. To your little one who is not yet born: listen to your mother the way I wish I did. To your hand in love to be: give her the life she dreamed of – the life, I realized, I never could have given._

_It started early on. Over the weeks, months, years, I found myself to be lycanthropous. A shapeshifting enigma. A monstrous, verminous bug<sup><sup>[\[73\]](#endnote-73)</sup></sup>. I would become a riddled code that I devised, but even one who’s maker could not construe. Plans would change, and my perpetually fanciful reveries would germinate throughout the soils of my conscience. I would flummox and confound with a million and one stratagems that I would use to fight the indefatigable. Over those years my life would become Galatea, and you would be my Pygmalion<sup><sup>[\[74\]](#endnote-74)</sup></sup>. I would be both handiwork and lover; out of terracotta I might become an Army; out of bronze I might become a Thinker; out of marble I might become a David…<sup><sup>[\[75\]](#endnote-75)</sup></sup>_

_Out of a clumping matter, perhaps I would be brought to life, crown emblazoned with a coronet of acquiescence, nape adorned with a necklace of assent. I would shape and shift, and like the tiding seas I would crash upon the hilt of jagged cliffs, lapping up towards the crest of the limestone, beckoning toward your siren song. The more I refashioned myself, however, the more I was mystified. The more I carved and molded and cast myself to the shapes of your liking, the more disfigured and grotesque I seemed. I wished to create you your Galatea, but I instead devised an abomination, a mare’s nest. I sought to be thy Adam but I instead became a crestfallen paragon. As Mary Shelly once quipped: “for nothing is so painful to the human mind as great and sudden change.”<sup><sup>[\[76\]](#endnote-76)</sup></sup> And Percy Bysshe, in accordance:_  

_"We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; > How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver, > Streaking the darkness radiantly! — yet soon > Night closes round, and they are lost forever”.<sup><sup>[\[77\]](#endnote-77)</sup></sup>_

_Out of all the arrangements I made from this patchwork of flesh and nexus of bone, no haphazard ordering ever yielded the fruit I envisioned. Truth, I came to realize, is not created in the mere ordering of things but is found, in its source, the reveries of the heart. The heart is the fount from which the power of workmanship animates - the source from which words can dance off the page, from which the pigments and binders may turn to ceremonial blood. It was as if I were taking a lump of matter, adventuring to consecrate it into divine flesh. It was an indubitable feat – not for the sacramental - but for the tarnished. For I was a leper seeking divination; bearing a coronet of thorns, I mused, would baptize me in a celestial ichor. By the puncturings from its prickles, my skull would be anointed with the holy substance – varnished with the lifeblood of a forlorn messiah._  

_These are moments that I think of what now seems, as clear as daybreak, the seeming folly of our enterprise. The cavern is deep and its wellsprings, a great distance. Though the love we shared was not regrettable, I do solemnly reminisce about those cherubic days, in that small, verdant city, with the woman I loved, in a place where time itself seemed to discontinue. The potent sorcery of who I was with you – the arcane powers to foster, love, and nurture – the desire to betroth, to make myself a patriarch of a diminutive kingdom. To triumphantly gallop down an ancestral path that turns back millennia. To bear the mantle of a lineal rite of passage. To surrender upon the altar of our love a sacrament and irrevocable covenant. To inherit, from a primordial time, a benefaction from human orders of the most ancient kind. These wearisome preoccupations have now been sent adrift in your absence._  

_It has been said that what is cast and does not return was never truly yours. It is as if, the memories of our maiden voyage, their seraphic chasteness, their virginal purity, is befouled by their very remembrance. The aspirations were, it seems to me now more clearly than ever, a desert with no oasis. An ephemeral Elysium from which I have forcibly awakened from. Not because our future was not achievable for you, but because of what life demands of me. But every evening, as I lay upon the bed to which I retire, my only hope is that the nightmare of life would lead me back to the chimeras of those now mythical hereafters. That, I could once more, with a naively lucid believability, could taste the lips of our imagined futures together, and their seemingly inevitable consummation. That, I could once more, and with an unshakable faith, imagine my ear pressed upon your belly and head upon your bosom, listening for the thrums of labor and love, and feel that it was imminent beyond a shadow of a doubt._

_I still reside there – perched upon the mantle of the horizon that never came to be. I look towards the nadirs of this world, incessantly questioning if it is better to dream on your feet or to accept fate on your knees. The touch of its lips is comforting but cold. The truth was that I was never meant for a typical, quotidian life. In my heart, although I ignored the call to action many times before, I understood myself as being prepared for a war that you could never have been a part of. I am being poised for battle with a Goliath<sup><sup>[\[78\]](#endnote-78)</sup></sup> – a battle whose toll will be great, from which I am unsure to even emerge from the other side. For the very reasons I might find myself - I also may lose myself. My adversary is injustice, and it does not bleed. It does not possess flesh, nor does it have marrow. It does not tire, nor does it falter. It is everywhere yet nowhere at once._

_It is in the cries of war-torn children and the screeching metallurgies of its conflagrations. It is the looming invariances within the flux and flow. It is a gargoyle that does not ward off evil spirits but instead summons them. The adversary that dwells in exclusionary codes. He furthers his Faustian creed. His doctrines of knowledge and his perverted eugenics of scholasticism do not seek truth but instead contort it to instrumental ends. He wages a New Napoleonic War on the soil of our very Being._

_He is what surveils, disciplines, and punishes. He is a perversion of the patriarchal father and is ever present, ever watching. Under the guise of objectivity, he captures us in his mechanical gaze, wielding the privileges of transcendental reason as a weapon, weaponizing legitimation as a tool to curry favor and reject. This is what I think to myself. You are going to be a great mother. You are going to possess the love and the family of your dreams. You will once again become enamored. Your belly will abound with the sounds of labor, and your home, the thrums of life. Another will love, protect and nurture you. And although the greatest desires of our dreams together might have proven to be too fanciful for this world, it is our Mythologies that make the burden of torch bearing bearable. Part of me will still reside there – perched upon that cold mantel. In that non-place. For the remaining eons. For now, part of me must leave, but one day I will return. When I do, we will walk hand in hand into the imaginings of our most fanciful reveries and journey into them, hand in hand into the horizon, voyaging toward the life we both wish we could have lived. And although at times we will fall prey to these stinging remembrances of the heart, we must remind ourselves that for every Goliath there is a David, and that this time it is not me who beckons – it is destiny._  

_Yours always,_  
_A._

⋯

In the wake of the letter, I am again drawn to the idea, like a gadfly to the light, of the heart as a home of both presence and absence. The heart, like non-places, can feel like a space where emotions, memories, and relationships enmesh, creating a tapestry of experiences and events that shape our sense of self. Yet, it is also a place where traces of lost loves, unfulfilled desires, and severed connections linger, often leaving an interminable sense of absence. The act of writing, of giving voice to the unspoken, is an attempt to bridge the gap between my desired presences and the many absences that haunt me. It is a way of acknowledging the unseen forces that shape my life. The _Mythologies_ _of the Heart_ that sustain us even as they betray us. The heart is a site of unbounded potential. It is a field where the perennials of thought, identity, and collectivity, bloom. By embracing the liminality of the heart, by acknowledging both its presence and its absence, we open ourselves to the possibility of radical transformation.

_Mythologies_ are the maps that guide us through this unbelievable terrain we call life. They are the stories we tell ourselves, and retell, about our many loves, losses, and longings. They are the narratives that help us make sense of the world and help place ourselves in it. In the end, perhaps this letter is not a farewell, but a testament to the enduring power of my love for Her. It is not a goodbye, but an “I Love You”, crystallized in the in-between, ever becoming. Ever present. It will remain a reminder that even in the face of loss and change, the heart continues to thrum, to dream, and to create, even long after we are gone. Our _Mythologies_, and the people in them, are what make the story of life so grand. Our grand _Mythologies_, even if they never did materialize in the Real, in our most precious moments, gave us meaning, love, and hope; this, then, is more real than any flesh you can hold. More real than any blood you can touch. These Mythologies continue to give me a space of connection I can inhabit – a sacred space – a bond between my presence and Her absence in my life.

_Journal Entry_

_Next month I will be 29. Ten years ago, I was in high school and in many ways, I am still exactly the same. I’m relentlessly stubborn. Delusional beyond belief. As anxiety ridden as ever. I am still thoroughly neurotic. But in other ways, I am completely different. I have gotten better at being alone. In fact, I like being alone to a questionable degree. I enjoy the predictability of absence. It doesn’t abandon, and it doesn’t disappoint. It is there when I am sequestered, and it accompanies me even when I gather among others. It reminds me that I am but a gadfly at a wedding reception. That I can inhabit the same room as they yet be doubly absent. That I am a mirage of a desert oasis. An apparition in a cathedral. A moon in a dewdrop. A figment of the imagination. I am more of an idea than an actual person. And it is strange to be in the world and not be of it. As if I am a visitor, passing through the thoroughfares of my existence, navigating geographies of memory as if they were places I had never before ventured. A labyrinth of my own intrigues._

_Where did time go? It slips through the corridors of thought with each passing day. When can I finally exist? Do I exist right now, at this very moment? Or am I merely half-involved in this little life of mine, perpetually yearning for something grander, more befitting for the seeming powers of my imagination? But perhaps that was the problem. You indeed can do anything you set your mind to in this life, but in setting a path and a destination, you lose pieces of yourself along the way. With prudence you then relegate those parts of yourself to the dustbins of history. Today, however, I am rummaging through what remains of me. One by one, I am picking up the pieces of myself I had forgotten along the way. Shards from a house of mirrors of my own creation. Only the contours, the semblance of a self. But still, an idea of myself that is more real than even that of my very flesh. More real than my very blood._

_As I rummage through the remnants of who I once was, sifting through the rubble of discarded selves. In these shards, I notice reflections of a life half-lived, ambitions half-pursued, dreams half-formed. And yet, there is beauty in the incompleteness, in the idea of myself that is more vivid, more vital, than blood or bone. For what is flesh but a fleeting vessel? What is time but a trick of the memory? Perhaps to exist is not to arrive but to gather—to reclaim what we have left behind and call it enough. And so, I saunter forward—not toward a destination, but into the quiet, unbounded process of becoming._

…

After finishing his ristretto, he leaned back for a moment, feeling the familiar jolt of clarity that hit like a tidal wave. The café was quiet for now, with only the faint hum of machines and the occasional shuffle of a customer. He thought about how mornings like these felt like sacred, ritualistic even. Small spaces carved out of the chaos within the thrumming of life. At was mid-morning when the café began to fill with the murmurs of patrons. The rhythmic grindings of coffee and the swishing of milk. He, what seemed to occur in an instant, felt the tug of an absent thread in his day.

_I hadn’t checked my phone all day,_ he noticed suddenly. The realization struck him as though he could feel every pound of his bodyweight, as though the missed hours had collapsed into a single moment. He wiped his hands on a rag and reached into his pocket, his phone cold against his palm as he turned it on. Notifications flooded the screen, unimportant and relentless—apps vying for attention, group chats blinking in the digital nether. He swiped them away impatiently, scrolling straight to the app where she’d messaged him last.

The ballooning feeling began again, faint but unmistakable, like the tremor of distant thunder. There it was—a message. Her name is at the top of the screen, a small blue dot marking it unread. He hesitated, the air around him seemed to thicken in a smog. He thumbed the notification but didn’t open it immediately, opting instead to stare at her profile photo—a snapshot of her laughing, head thrown into the horizon, caught in some golden-hour moment of unselfconscious mirth.

Finally, he tapped the message.

"Hey! Was thinking about you—are you feeling better? Any plans for the weekend?"

The words hit him like what he imagined a hit of heroin felt like, something primal, ecstatic, and completely electric. For a brief moment, he didn’t know what to do. His hands hovered, the warmth of the phone seeping into his skin as his thoughts churned. The café around him felt distant, reduced to sound and motion without meaning.

What could he say? Should he play it cool, pretend he hadn’t been thinking about her every day - all day? Or should splay his viscera—to finally tell her how the spaces between her words seemed to stretch into whole lifetimes? Revealing to her that she made him feel as though he was standing in the radiance of something eternal?

The ringing of the café bell jolted him back. A customer was at the counter, waiting for him to take their order. He shoved the phone into his apron pocket and forced a smile. “Hey there! Oh, it’s a mobile order? I will be right with you,” he said, his voice steady, betraying none of the storm inside.

As he worked, pouring shots and steaming milk, the message sat in his pocket like a fishhook. He replayed her words over and over, tasting every inch of their possibilities. Maybe this was something real, something worth risking something other than a life as a gadfly. The feeling that always seemed to accompany him like his own shadow. When the rush slowed, he pulled his phone out again, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. His heart thumped hard in his chest, as if reminding him that it was still there, still alive, still _here_, hinting toward something new.

_Hey, good to hear from you. Feeling a lot better, actually. No plans yet—what about you?_

He pressed send before he could second-guess himself. The message left, carrying with it all his anxieties, his hopes, and the lingering specter of what might come next. For the first time in days, the weight in his chest seemed to lift. He glanced outside, catching a shaft of sunlight streaming through the venetian blinds. It wasn’t much, but it felt like something—a start. Maybe not the Sea of Fog he imagined, but a small step toward something new. It felt like the very instant one is about to begin a new novel, or the moment one’s gaze meets a treasured work of art – a new fiction, waiting to be realized.

74. _Pygmalion_ alludes to the Greek myth in which the sculptor Pygmalion falls in love with a statue he created, which is later brought to life by the goddess Aphrodite. I use the mythological figure of Pygmalion to express the process of transformation and self-creation. I envision myself in this context as a work of art, shaped by Her desires and actions, constantly evolving in response to affirmative or negative affirmation. I try to highlight here the tension between being both the creator and the supposed creation, suggesting a complex relationship between agency, identity, and the desire for inner change.
