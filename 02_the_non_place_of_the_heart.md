# The Non-Place of the Heart

I am constantly trying to communicate something  
incommunicable, to explain something inexplicable, to tell  
about something I only feel in my bones and which can only  
be experienced in those bones (...)  

There is disquiet in the atrium, but he can almost hear temerity in every inhalation. Across the circulation desk, his eyes catch her as she checks out a patron’s books. He disremembered who, but someone a few months ago had suggested to him that if he wanted to meet people that he should leave his apartment every now and then. A scrawling voice opining that he should frequent more public places. Parks. Coffee shops. Libraries. Perhaps it was his therapist who mentioned this. Or his mother. The difference between the two, it sometimes seemed, only he knew. Whoever mentioned it, as it felt in that instant, it did not seem like such a great idea any longer.

His hands were wrought with tension, his brow continually ornamented with a crown of perspiration he desperately attempted to relinquish. He had rehearsed the scene in his head – the encounter. He rehearsed on the way there. In the car. Again, in the library vestibule. Now, he was ambling back and forth in the lobby appearing like a deranged sycophant. He trembled with apprehension as if he were being led backstage to see Taylor Swift or U2 after months of planning how to sneak into the venue. He took a few benzodiazepines just before. They were fast acting, but seemed to be taking their time to kick in. He made sure to prep some beforehand, brutishly gulping down a few before anyone could notice. They should be hitting right about now, he thinks to himself.

But they weren’t. They didn’t. They didn’t hit, you druggie. And then what feels like the hours yawning away from him, he eventually finds himself again in his car, technocore hammering his ears on full blast. He pulls out his phone and doomscrolls, attempting to dissociate his body from the angst in his mind. One after the other: “’you know you’ve found the one when (…)’; ‘I don’t miss them, I miss who I was when I was with them (…)’; ‘If you really love someone, you would even be willing to let them go (…).’”

Honestly fuck this algorithm, he says to himself. He goes to his saved reels folder. He sees a David Goggins thumbnail he archived earlier. He opens it. “Who’s gonna carry the boats! (…)” Then - a tapping on the window. It’s her. Her eyes gleam at him with the élan vital of a something formidable. Something interstellar. He quickly looks down so as to not be scorched by the solar flares; frantically, he wrangles himself around as if he were orchestrating a cirque du soleil, performing and trouncing under the guise of doing something. Something important, perhaps.

Was he rummaging through the car to find something? Did his wallet fall under the car seat again? No, he was detracting from the obvious – him trying to Redpill himself a hit of testosterone that might help him muster the courage to ask her out. He rolls down the window. M., it’s good to see you, he says. It’s always good to see you, he thinks to himself. She smiles. They exchange pleasantries. He notices a flecking of light refracting from her earrings. They are rose-tinted hoops, and they complement the crimson braiding in her necklace. Her nails are French tipped. It’s a balmy summer night and he catches a peripheral of a streak of perspiration beading down her bosom and into her cleavage. He makes sure to keep eye contact. Is she going out? Is she going out with her friends? Is she going out with a boyfriend? He doesn’t know. He is just embarrassed at the whole situation.

I saw you inside, she says, again with that familiar smile. She has a look on her face that is both alluring and bashful to the eyes. He tells her he was picking up new books. On a Friday night? She inquires with a wry, withering wit. Inside him, flutterings of Lepidoptera uncage themselves. He can feel the reddening of his ears. Visibly apple-cheeked, he looks to play it off. I’m actually not feeling too well - I planned to stay inside tonight, he says. He wants to pry. He then asks her what she’s doing this weekend. Just with some friends tonight, she says. But she doesn’t know what she’s doing on Saturday or Sunday. She notices his apprehension; she knows what he wants. If you’re feeling better, let me know if you’re free? You have me on Instagram, right?

Right.

He drives home in the dusking dark, maneuvering through boulevards that never seem to end. He downs an edible on the way home and glances a few times at the stars. No wonder it’s dark out tonight, he thinks to himself. She’s not up there. He laughs to himself, as he usually does when he cracks his own jokes. It’s now past sundown and he arrives home. His roommate isn’t there. Thank God, because the edible is starting to hit. He unwinds for the night and finds himself curling under the sheets. He sees she’s online on the app. The ballooning creeps up again. The spaces between the letters of the keyboard are moving further away from one another, slowly transforming into a latticework of symbols indecipherable to his intellect. He made sure he had Keaton Henson playing in the background. His music in particular usually calms him. It reminded him of being aboard a sailboat, the bough rocking steadily at the marina upon the quietude of a summer evening. This might be just enough to avoid a bad trip. The music reverberates like what he interprets to be the sounds of labor and love. He feels the composition all the way to his very bones, filled with a kind of newborn mirth. And to the enveloping tastes of the sounds, the organ squarely positioned in his chest thrums in unison to its orchestrated march. He lays the phone at his side and now swept into the tidings of melody and vistas of sound. He is restful. He thinks to himself – maybe next week.

## Journal Entry

Tomorrow, I start a job at a small café. It is nestled in a small pocket of suburbia, deep in the heart of the township. The neighborhood in which it resides abounds in a reassuring quietude, and it thrums with its familiar sounds and resonances. Sometimes, there is a pervasive silence, like in the dead of night. The gloaming would envelop the boulevards, and the indistinct glow of the moon would peek through the floating nimbuses. Its night sky would be peppered with darkening radiances. God, how they gleam. The firmament would envelop the trinkets in its familiar nightfall. The Dipper stove. Other times, my eardrums would be besieged with the sounds of children enacting their habitual crusades. They would frolic in the streets and behave in their familiar ways, drunkenly springing about in their recognizable manners. They would rip the verdure from the ground and would stain their clothes in blotches and streaks of green. Just a year ago, these panoramas of suburbia I saw before me would instead be interchanged with colorless walls. I would sit at my cubicle, uninspired by the dreary enclosure. I would engage in savorless exchanges with unhappy looking coworkers as they harped over spreadsheets and month-end financials.

 I stopped by the café earlier today. It was colored in mauves and crimsons of all shades. The smell of espresso filled the air, and in my midst were the thrumming of everyday lives in full bloom. Jazz softly played in the background, and I caught my body almost gamboling to the music. I met with my manager, and I noticed the tattoo on her hand. She seemed only a little bit older than me. She was pleasant, cheerful, and full of both life and energy. I handed her some documents that were requested and left with a quasar in my chest. I noticed something when I went outside. There were a flock of fledgling birds, and they chirruped and warbled in the distance. A group of recent hatchlings were all perched upon the branches of the tree, and I studied them closely. As I watched the birds resting upon the boughs, a sense of anticipation welled up inside me. Tomorrow, a new chapter begins—one far removed from the stark walls and hollow exchanges of my past. The café, in many respects, seemed to promise something deeper and more human than a life of financial security alone could ever bring. The hatchlings warbled again - their petite bodies trembling with life and possibility. Perhaps, I thought, we were not so different - perched here, on the precipice of something new, ready to take flight into uncharted skies.

It is next week now. It slowly crept up on him - time. The lost time that creeps up on us all. He didn’t check his phone that Thursday – he was busy working and had been running errands all late afternoon. He’s a barista at a café in town and he takes the morning shift. As the day uncurtained the night, gloamings of light peppered his visage through the dotted gaps in the bedroom shutters. He heard the other day that today was supposed to be busier than usual – for some reason or another – he didn’t know. He was a tad late, but he managed to be there before anyone noticed, before any customers could complain. He opened the store and went about his routine. Next to the coffee station, he grabbed the portafilter from the grouphead, but noticed the night shift had mistakenly left (or intentionally, he could never tell) residue in its basket. He dispensed with the gunk already consumed and purged the deposit into the knock box. Then it was time to dial in. Gathering the grated beans in the portafilter basket, he used the tamp to compress the grounds into a mush. Of course, he used his body weight; using your wrist to perform a thrusting motion can injure it over the long term, as any skilled barista would know. And as he pulled the shot to make the ristretto, he could already taste the sour in his nostrils.

This blend in particular had notes of cherry, so an incorrect grind size or extraction time could, occasionally, overpower the senses with a fruitful acerbity. He adjusted the settings and pulled another shot. This one was a delight, the perfect balance of bitter and tart. At this point you want to adjust the water flow. And so, he did. For ristretto, the ideal is about 20 milliliters or 0.7 ounces. He goes to pull the shot once more. 19 seconds. 20 seconds. 21 seconds. The extraction took the perfect amount of time. Any longer, and it would taste more like mere espresso. Ristretto style is characterized by a particular intensity. A more concentrated experience than that of espresso. Left to pull for more time and the flavor profile might have been lost to the winds. He slurps it in a rather uncivilized fashion, but he craves the hit. He wants to feel on edge, as if he is on the precipice of something grandeur. He wants to careen toward the sublime. A Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog. And a morning ristretto, indeed, does the trick. Mixed with an Adderall, he has thus become a Caesar, and for this small moment, he might exclaim: I came, I saw, I conquered.

Kafka, Franz. *Letters to Milena*. Translated by Philip Boehm, Schocken Books, 1990.¹

Ludwig Wittgenstein asserts in the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* that "the limits of my language mean the limits of my world," emphasizing the primacy of language in shaping our understanding of reality. For Wittgenstein, language is not merely a tool for communication but a framework that defines the boundaries of what can be thought and expressed. Consequently, anything beyond the realm of language is also beyond the realm of conceptualization and meaning. See Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*, translated by C.K. Ogden, Routledge, 1922, proposition 5.6.²

Roland Barthes’ *Mythologies* (trans. Annette Lavers, New York: Hill and Wang, 1972) analyzes how everyday objects and cultural phenomena become ideological myths, reinforcing dominant social structures. However, while Barthes focuses on demystifying these ideological functions, our approach extends beyond mere ideological critique to explore myths as dynamic, affective, and ontological structures that shape perception and lived experience. For a perspective that similarly moves beyond ideological analysis, see Jean Baudrillard, *Simulacra and Simulation* (trans. Sheila Faria Glaser, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1994), which examines the disappearance of the real into self-referential signs.³

Deleuze and Guattari conceptualize desire as a productive, machinic force that resists repression and produces flows within social and economic structures. However, rather than focusing solely on desire as a productive mechanism, we extend this notion to argue that desire is not just generative but constitutive of reality itself—shaping ontological structures and determining what is (or is not) actualized within a given field of experience. This resonates with speculative philosophies that explore the co-creation of being and becoming through desire.⁴

Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) is a philosophical movement that challenges anthropocentric perspectives by asserting that all objects—whether human, nonhuman, natural, or artificial—exist independently of human perception. Coined by Graham Harman, OOO argues that objects have their own realities, relations, and agency beyond their interactions with humans. This framework rejects correlationism (the idea that existence is always tied to human thought) and instead posits a "flat ontology" where no entity holds ontological priority over another.⁵

A nod to when Camus reflects on the resilience of the human spirit in his essay “Return to Tipasa,” writing, “In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.” This line encapsulates Camus’s existential philosophy, emphasizing the enduring strength and hope that persists even in the face of despair. See Albert Camus, “Return to Tipasa,” *Lyrical and Critical Essays*, translated by Ellen Conroy Kennedy, edited by Philip Thody, Vintage International, 1970.⁶

Kirsch, in his article "Fernando Pessoa’s Disappearing Act," examines the enigmatic nature of Fernando Pessoa, a Portuguese poet and novelist known for his use of heteronyms — distinct literary personas each with their own style, worldview, and biography. Kirsch highlights how Pessoa’s literary fragmentation reflects a deliberate erasure of a unified self, allowing him to explore multiple perspectives on identity, existence, and creativity. This act of "disappearing" through his heteronyms complicates traditional notions of authorship and individuality. See Adam Kirsch, "Fernando Pessoa’s Disappearing Act," *The New Yorker*, 4 Sept. 2017.⁷

I mean especially today as it emphasizes the state of the current milieu and the collective tendency to valorize stability, predictability, and continuity. In an age characterized by uncertainty and rapid change — driven by technological advancement, economic precarity, and poly-crises — there is an increased cultural investment in the ideal of a tranquil, secure existence. This is reflected in the pervasive glorification of domestic stability, consumer comforts, and curated lifestyles in media and advertising, which create sentiments of fulfillment and meaning. These might detract from questions and the inherent flow of human life, rendering such pursuits a "simulacrum of the Real," as described by Baudrillard. See Jean Baudrillard. *Simulacra and Simulation*. Translated by Sheila Faria Glaser, University of Michigan Press, 1994.⁸

Collegiate Gothic, an architectural style popularized in American university campuses during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, draws inspiration from the medieval Gothic architecture of European universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. Designed to evoke tradition, intellectual gravitas, and prestige, the style is characterized by pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and ornate stone detailing. In this context, structures like Blair Hall and the University Chapel embody a particular aesthetic while reflecting the wealth and aspirations of the institution.⁹

Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari introduce the concept of the "body without organs" (BwO) as a metaphorical construct representing a body stripped of organization, hierarchy, and imposed structure. It challenges traditional notions of identity and the organism by emphasizing potentiality, fluidity, and desiring-production. The BwO is not a literal body but an open system resisting stratification and facilitating the free flow of intensities and desires. See Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, *A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia*, translated by Brian Massumi, University of Minnesota Press, 1987.¹⁰

The phrase "Schrödinger’s Gadfly" evokes a fusion of two distinct philosophical and scientific ideas. Schrödinger’s Cat, a famous thought experiment in quantum mechanics, illustrates the paradox of superposition, where a system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. Socrates, often referred to as Athens’ “gadfly,” symbolizes a disruptive presence, persistently questioning and challenging norms and beliefs. Combining these concepts, “Schrödinger’s Gadfly” might suggest a state of paradoxical existence — simultaneously present and disruptive, yet unobserved or marginalized. In this context, it reflects a sentiment of being both within and apart from the spaces one inhabits, embodying a role that is simultaneously intrusive and invisible, questioning but constrained by their own alterity.¹¹

Augé, Marc. *Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity*. Translated by John Howe, Verso, 1995.¹²

More specifically, Marc Augé defines non-places as transient spaces that lack the relational, historical, and identity-driven significance of traditional “places.” These spaces, such as airports, highways, and shopping malls, are designed for functionality and anonymity, facilitating movement and consumption rather than fostering connections or rootedness. In this context, non-places become emblematic of the disconnection and excess characteristic of contemporary Supermodernity, where individuals navigate spaces devoid of personal or communal attachment. See Note 12.¹³

The concept of “deterritorialization”, as developed in *A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia*, refers to the process by which established structures, meanings, or territories are destabilized or displaced. It signifies the breaking down of boundaries, whether physical, cultural, or conceptual, enabling new flows and connections. Often paired with reterritorialization, which involves the re-establishment of order or meaning in new contexts, deterritorialization highlights the dynamic and fluid nature of systems, identities, and spaces. See Note 10.¹⁴

Which means, rhizomatically. The concept of the “rhizome,” as introduced in *A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia*, describes a non-hierarchical, decentralized, and interconnected mode of organization. Unlike the linear and rooted structure of a tree, the rhizome spreads in multiple directions, forming a network without a clear origin or endpoint. To deterritorialize rhizomatically means to challenge traditional models of knowledge, identity, and systems while simultaneously emphasize multiplicity, diversity, and lateral connections over singularity and vertical authority. See Note 10.¹⁵

An aphorism attributed to Søren Kierkegaard, encapsulates here the paradoxical nature of human existence. While the events of life can only be fully comprehended in hindsight, life itself unfolds in the uncertainty of the present and the unknowability of the future. Kierkegaard explores this tension in *Journals and Papers*, where he reflects on the nature of temporality and existence, suggesting that understanding requires retrospection, yet action demands forward motion. This duality speaks to the existential challenge of living authentically, as one navigates the irreconcilable gap between knowing and being, past and future. See Søren Kierkegaard. *Journals and Papers*. Translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong, Indiana University Press, 1967.¹⁶

Virtualities refer to latent potentials or possibilities that exist within a system, awaiting actualization. In the philosophical framework of Deleuze, virtuality does not imply a lack of existence but rather denotes a realm of real potential distinct from concrete actuality. Virtualities are dynamic and generative potentials, offering a space for new configurations, forms, and connections to emerge. They underpin the transformative processes of becoming, challenging static or fixed understandings of identity, space, and systems. See Gilles Deleuze, *Difference and Repetition*, translated by Paul Patton, Columbia University Press, 1994.¹⁷

This plane, as conceptualized by Deleuze (often in collaboration with Guattari), refers to a foundational, pre-conceptual field of pure potentiality and becoming. It is a realm where all entities, concepts, and events exist in a state of interconnected flux, without hierarchy or transcendence. Unlike a transcendental framework that imposes external order, the plane of immanence is self-organizing and allows for the emergence of new forms of thought and existence. It serves as a philosophical ground for understanding how ideas and phenomena are constructed without recourse to external metaphysical structures. See Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, *What Is Philosophy?*, translated by Hugh Tomlinson and Graham Burchell, Columbia University Press, 1994.¹⁸

“Substance metaphysics” refers to a philosophical framework, originating in Aristotelian and Cartesian traditions, that prioritizes the concept of stable, enduring entities or “substances” as the fundamental building blocks of reality. This perspective assumes that entities have intrinsic, fixed essences that define their identity and persist through change. In contrast, critiques of substance metaphysics, such as those found in process philosophy (e.g., Whitehead) and poststructuralist thought (e.g., Deleuze), challenge this rigidity by emphasizing flux, becoming, and relationality over fixed essences. For a critique of substance metaphysics. See Note 17.¹⁹

In Alain Badiou’s philosophy, an “event” is a radical occurrence that disrupts the established order of being and knowledge, opening up the possibility for new truths. Events are not part of the regular state of things. Instead, they emerge unpredictably and reconfigure the conditions of thought and action. For Badiou, fidelity to an event involves recognizing and committing to its transformative potential, often in politics, science, art, or love. Events challenge the dominance of established structures, creating room for novelty and innovation. See Alain Badiou, *Being and Event*, translated by Oliver Feltham, Continuum, 2005.²⁰

Mythologies of the Heart, as we will see, delve into the spaces between presence and absence, blurring the boundaries of fiction, philosophy, and lived experience. It explores liminality as both a metaphor and a mode of being, drawing on concepts like Marc Augé's "non-places" and Derrida's "traces" to frame the heart as a site of both alienation and potentiality. I interrogate how certain societal structures erase individual presence, rendering many minoritarian groups invisible, while also reclaiming these unseen spaces as fertile grounds for revolutionary thought and emotional transformation. These "Mythologies" are not fabrications, but are cartographies of the in-between, charting paths through love, memory, and loss to help imagine novel ways of being and belonging.²¹

Emotion operates similarly to memory, creating constructs that shape how we perceive and interact with the world. Joy, grief, longing, or love transform the internal terrain of a person, becoming sites of profound personal significance. These emotional places are deeply tied to the Mythologies of the Heart, as they embody the narratives we tell ourselves to navigate life's uncertainties and losses. Love, in particular, becomes a "place" where we dwell—a sanctuary, a battlefield, or, what we will further in this essay, a non-place – a location that defies reductionist classification.²²

The term “lifeworld” (Lebenswelt) originates in the phenomenological philosophy of Edmund Husserl and refers to the pre-reflective, everyday world of lived experience. It encompasses the cultural, social, and historical contexts in which individuals exist and interact. Lifeworlds are the foundational, taken-for-granted structures of meaning that shape how people perceive, understand, and navigate the world. They are deeply influenced by collective traditions, linguistic frameworks, and individual subjectivity, acting as the background against which all experience occurs. This concept has been further developed in sociology by Jürgen Habermas, who contrasts the lifeworld with the systemic mechanisms of modern society, such as markets and bureaucracies. For more on the concept, see Edmund Husserl, *The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology: An Introduction to Phenomenological Philosophy*, translated by David Carr, Northwestern University Press, 1970.²³

These geographies parallel the shaping of physical places with the formation of personal identity. Just as landscapes are formed by natural forces and historical events, the self is shaped by an accretion of sense-experiences, relationships, and memories, creating a unique and dynamic internal terrain. This notion views identity as a process of becoming, marked by the residual imprints of pivotal events and interactions. Like how battlefields bear scars of war or sacred sites resonate with devotion, individuals carry within them traces of their histories. The "geography of the self" positions identity as a relational and evolving construct, shaped by the interplay of personal and collective narratives, and by the fluid interaction between the past and present.²⁴

Internal geography, more technically, refers to ontological situatedness. This refers to the condition of being embedded within a specific context of existence, shaped by the interplay of one's identity, environment, and relational structures. It acknowledges that our understanding of self and reality is not fixed but emerges through the dynamic interaction of historical, cultural, and phenomenological factors. This concept draws on Heidegger’s Being-in-the-World (Dasein), emphasizing that our existence is always "thrown" into a pre-existing world of meaning and constraints. Heidegger describes this in *Being and Time* as the fundamental structure of human existence (Sein und Zeit, 1927). Situatedness frames our ontological experience as inherently contingent, urging a recognition of how power, positionality, and the limits of perspective shape the possibilities of understanding and action within the world. See Martin Heidegger, *Being and Time*. Translated by John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson, Harper Perennial Modern Thought, 2008.²⁵ The term "phenomenological" refers to a philosophical approach that emphasizes the study of conscious experiences from the first-person perspective. It involves examining the structures of experience and consciousness to understand how we perceive and interpret the world around us. This approach is often associated with the works of philosophers like Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger.²⁶

Merleau-Ponty explores the idea of absence as a generative force versus perception and existence. Merleau-Ponty challenges traditional notions of presence and absence, proposing that absence is not merely a void but an essential aspect of the perceptual world, allowing for the emergence of new ways of being and understanding. In this work, he discusses how absence, or the invisible, plays a key role in the experience of the visible and in the formation of meaning. This aligns with phenomenological perspectives that regard absence as an active space for potentiality, shaping the contours of identity, thought, and collective experience. See Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. *The Visible and the Invisible*. Translated by Alphonso Lingis, Northwestern University Press, 1968.²⁷

The dynamic interplay between closure and fixity mirrors contradictions inherent to the human condition. On one hand, we seek stability and certainty to make sense of our lives; on the other, we yearn for the freedom to explore uncharted territories of our hearts and minds. Mythologies, therefore, become vitally essential personae through which we navigate these tensions, offering spaces where the rigidity of closure and fixity can be transcended. By maintaining an openness to the fluidity of our narratives, we honor the complexities of our emotions and memories. We allow for the possibility of reconciliation, healing, and discovery, even in the face of loss and change.²⁸ This Politics refers to the radical potential inherent in the act of dreaming and envisioning alternate futures, presenting dreaming as an act of resistance against the constraints of the present reality. This concept challenges the accepted narratives of what is deemed realistic or inevitable, offering a space for reimagining the world beyond current systems of power, rationality, and hierarchy. It is not an escape but a deliberate engagement with possibility, particularly in non-places — those liminal, transient zones where meaning can be reformed in nonlinear, emergent ways. The politics of the dreamable foreground speculative thinking as fertile ground for collective liberation, enabling marginalized voices to shape new realities that defy systemic inertia and totalizing narratives. It asserts that through dreaming, one can reclaim spaces where the conventional rules no longer apply, making room for new modes of being and revolutionary change.²⁹

Self-organization (or autopoiesis) refers to a system's ability to maintain and reproduce itself through its own internal processes, without external direction or control. This concept, developed by biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, emphasizes how their capacity to autonomously create and regulate their own structures and functions characterizes living systems. In the context of the Politics of the Dreamable, self-organizing assemblages highlight the potential for meaning and order to emerge spontaneously and non-hierarchically, challenging the deterministic frameworks imposed by external authorities. Rather than relying on preordained structures, self-organizing systems enable the dynamic, emergent formation of new possibilities, much like the radical reimagining of the future through dreaming. See Maturana, Humberto R., and Francisco J. Varela. *Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living*. D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1980.³⁰

Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of polyvocality, introduced in his analysis of the novel in *The Dialogic Imagination*, refers to the coexistence and interaction of multiple voices or perspectives within a text. Rather than a singular, dominant voice, Bakhtin argues that polyvocality represents the interplay of various viewpoints, each with its own legitimacy, which challenges the idea of a unified, authoritative narrative. This idea of multiple, competing voices has been applied not only to literature but also to broader social and cultural contexts, emphasizing the complexity and diversity of discourse in shaping meaning. See Bakhtin, Mikhail. *The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays*. Edited by Michael Holquist, translated by Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist, University of Texas Press, 1981.³¹

In this context, rebellion is not merely an opposition to authority or tradition, but a personal and existential stance against the status quo, asserting one's autonomy and individuality in the face of oppressive forces. Camus suggests that to rebel is to reject imposed meaning and the totalizing narratives of society, opting instead to affirm one’s own subjective truth. This rebellious act becomes a declaration of the will to create alternative realities, a central idea in the Politics of the Dreamable, where dreaming and imagining new possibilities serve as acts of resistance. See Camus, Albert. *The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt*. Translated by Anthony Bower, Vintage Books, 1991.³²
