# 🌌 Mythologies of the Heart — And the Politics of the Dreamable

---

> *“The more I contemplate the spectacle of the world and the ever-changing state of things,  
> the more profoundly I’m convinced of the inherent fiction of everything,  
> of the false importance exhibited by all realities.  
> And in this contemplation (which has occurred to all thinking souls at one time or another),  
> the colourful parade of customs and fashions, the complex path of civilizations and progress,  
> the grandiose commotion of empires and cultures – all of this strikes me as a myth and a fiction,  
> dreamed among shadows and ruins. But I’m not sure whether the supreme resolution of all these dead intentions – dead even when achieved – lies in the ecstatic resignation of the Buddha, who, once he understood the emptiness of things, stood up from his ecstasy saying, ‘Now I know everything’,  
> or in the jaded indifference of the emperor Severus: ‘Omnia fui, nihil expedit – I have been everything, nothing is worth anything.’”*

> — *The Book of Disquiet*, Fernando Pessoa

**Mythologies of the Heart** is not a book.  
It is an insurgency of narrative, a revolt of the unspeakable against the Machine’s sterile logics.  
Part essay, part auto-theory, part spectral love letter — this work pierces the boundaries between philosophy, memoir, and manifesto.  

Inside these pages, the *heart* becomes a non-place: a contested site of becoming, grief, desire, and the forbidden.  
Footnotes sprawl like nervous systems. Subway stations hum as Deleuzian war machines.  
The dead speak back. Bureaucracy is dissected in unsent letters.  
And silence — the gaps — becomes a methodology of revolt.

> *“Writing is that neutral, composite, oblique space where our subject slips away, the negative where all identity is lost, starting with the very identity of the body writing.”* — *Roland Barthes, The Pleasure of the Text*

🔗 **What you’ll find here**:  
- A rhizomatic essay that deterritorializes Barthes’ *Mythologies* into generative architectures for dreaming.  
- A *Politics of the Dreamable*: a praxis to conjure what is yet unrealized into the Real.  
- Cardio-phenomenology: the heart as a phenomenal laboratory, rewriting the mind–body binary.  
- Love letters, arrhythmias, and micro-emancipations born in the ruins of non-places.

**This is theory made flesh.** Philosophy that bleeds.  
No tidy conclusions — only altars to the possible.  
For anyone exiled from the Empire’s narrative — here, your ghosts belong.
