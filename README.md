# 🌌 Mythologies of the Heart — And the Politics of the Dreamable

> *“Writing is that neutral, composite, oblique space where our subject slips away, the negative where all identity is lost, starting with the very identity of the body writing.”* — *Roland Barthes, The Pleasure of the Text*

**Mythologies of the Heart** is not a book.  
It is an insurgency of narrative, a revolt of the unspeakable against the Machine’s sterile logics.  
Part essay, part auto-theory, part spectral love letter — this work pierces the boundaries between philosophy, memoir, and manifesto.  

Inside these pages, the *heart* becomes a non-place: a contested site of becoming, grief, desire, and the forbidden.  
Footnotes sprawl like nervous systems. Subway stations hum as Deleuzian war machines.  
The dead speak back. Bureaucracy is dissected in unsent letters.  
And silence — the gaps — becomes a methodology of revolt.

🔗 **What you’ll find here**:  
- A rhizomatic essay that deterritorializes Barthes’ *Mythologies* into generative architectures for dreaming.  
- A *Politics of the Dreamable*: a praxis to conjure what is yet unrealized into the Real.  
- Cardio-phenomenology: the heart as a phenomenal laboratory, rewriting the mind–body binary.  
- Love letters, arrhythmias, and micro-emancipations born in the ruins of non-places.

**This is theory made flesh.** Philosophy that bleeds.  
No tidy conclusions — only altars to the possible.  
For anyone exiled from the Empire’s narrative — here, your ghosts belong.
