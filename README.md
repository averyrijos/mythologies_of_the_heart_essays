# 🌙 Mythologies of The Heart — And The Politics of the Dreamable

**A radical work of autotheory, speculative poetics, and affective philosophy**  

> *“Mythologies are not just stories. They are architectures of the possible.”*

## 💭 What is this?

**Mythologies of The Heart** is not a conventional essay.  
It’s an evolving rhizome: memoir, manifesto, and philosophical revolt stitched together through fractured narrative, raw memory, and non-places of grief and longing.

At its core, this work explores:

- **The Heart as Non-Place:** How we carry secret geographies within us.
- **Deterritorializations:** How language and place undo each other.
- **Affective Cartographies:** The maps we draw through desire, rupture, and dream.
- **The Politics of the Dreamable:** A praxis for imagining what the Machine says is impossible.

Part poetic treatise, part field manual for dreamers, this text is a rebellion against closure — an invitation to reimagine reality as porous, haunted, and still possible.

## ✨ Why this exists

I wrote this because the world often denies us the right to feel deeply — to linger in what could be.  
In a time of algorithmic flattening, *Mythologies of The Heart* insists that the act of dreaming is political, and the act of writing is a site of perpetual becoming.

This is my attempt to make Derrida bleed and Didion theorize —  
to craft a form where autotheory, affect studies, and heartbreak spill into each other.
