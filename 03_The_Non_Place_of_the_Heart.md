## The Non-Place of the Heart

_I am constantly trying to communicate something_

_incommunicable, to explain something inexplicable, to tell_

_about something I only feel in my bones and which can only_

_be experienced in those bones (...)<sup><sup>[\[1\]](#endnote-1)</sup></sup>_

There is disquiet in the atrium, but he can almost hear temerity in every inhalation. Across the circulation desk, his eyes catch her as she checks out a patron’s books. He disremembered who, but someone a few months ago had suggested to him that if he wanted to meet people that he should leave his apartment every now and then. A scrawling voice opining that he should frequent more _public_ places. Parks. Coffee shops. Libraries. Perhaps it was his therapist who mentioned this. Or his mother. The difference between the two, it sometimes seemed, only he knew. Whoever mentioned it, as it felt in that instant, it did not seem like such a great idea any longer.

His hands were wrought with tension, his brow continually ornamented with a crown of perspiration he desperately attempted to relinquish. He had rehearsed the scene in his head – the encounter. He rehearsed on the way there. In the car. Again, in the library vestibule. Now, he was ambling back and forth in the lobby appearing like a deranged sycophant. He trembled with apprehension as if he were being led backstage to see Taylor Swift or U2 after months of planning how to sneak into the venue. He took a few benzodiazepines just before. They were fast acting, but seemed to be taking their time to kick in. He made sure to prep some beforehand, brutishly gulping down a few before anyone could notice. _They should be hitting right about now_, he thinks to himself.

But they weren’t. They didn’t. They didn’t hit, you druggie. And then what feels like the hours yawning away from him, he eventually finds himself again in his car, technocore hammering his ears on full blast. He pulls out his phone and doomscrolls, attempting to dissociate his body from the angst in his mind. One after the other: _“’you know you’ve found the one when (…)’; ‘I don’t miss them, I miss who I was when I was with them (…)’; ‘If you really love someone, you would even be willing to let them go_ (…).’”

_Honestly fuck this algorithm_, he says to himself. He goes to his saved reels folder. He sees a David Goggins thumbnail he archived earlier. He opens it. “Who’s gonna carry the boats! (…)_”_ Then - a tapping on the window. It’s her. Her eyes gleam at him with the _élan vital_ of a something formidable. Something interstellar. He quickly looks down so as to not be scorched by the solar flares; frantically, he wrangles himself around as if he were orchestrating a _cirque du soleil,_ performing and trouncing under the guise of doing something. Something important, perhaps.

Was he rummaging through the car to find something? Did his wallet fall under the car seat again? No, he was detracting from the obvious – him trying to Redpill himself a hit of testosterone that might help him muster the courage to ask her out. He rolls down the window. _M.,_ _it’s good to see you_, he says. _It’s always good to see you,_ he thinks to himself_._ She smiles. They exchange pleasantries. He notices a flecking of light refracting from her earrings. They are rose-tinted hoops, and they complement the crimson braiding in her necklace. Her nails are French tipped. It’s a balmy summer night and he catches a peripheral of a streak of perspiration beading down her bosom and into her cleavage. He makes sure to keep eye contact. _Is she going out? Is she going out with her friends? Is she going out with a boyfriend?_ He doesn’t know. He is just embarrassed at the whole situation.

_I saw you inside_, she says, again with that familiar smile. She has a look on her face that is both alluring and bashful to the eyes. He tells her he was picking up new books. _On a Friday night?_ She inquires with a wry, withering wit. Inside him, flutterings of Lepidoptera uncage themselves. He can feel the reddening of his ears. Visibly apple-cheeked, he looks to play it off_._ _I’m actually not feeling too well - I planned to stay inside tonight_, he says. _He wants to pry._ He then asks her what she’s doing this weekend. _Just with some friends tonight_, she says. But she doesn’t know what she’s doing on Saturday or Sunday. She notices his apprehension; she knows what he wants. I_f you’re feeling better, let me know if you’re free? You have me on Instagram, right?_

_Right_.

He drives home in the dusking dark, maneuvering through boulevards that never seem to end. He downs an edible on the way home and glances a few times at the stars. _No wonder it’s dark out tonight_, he thinks to himself. _She’s not up there_. He laughs to himself, as he usually does when he cracks his own jokes. It’s now past sundown and he arrives home. His roommate isn’t there. Thank God, because the edible is starting to hit. He unwinds for the night and finds himself curling under the sheets. He sees she’s online on the app. The ballooning creeps up again. The spaces between the letters of the keyboard are moving further away from one another, slowly transforming into a latticework of symbols indecipherable to his intellect. He made sure he had Keaton Henson playing in the background. His music in particular usually calms him. It reminded him of being aboard a sailboat, the bough rocking steadily at the marina upon the quietude of a summer evening. This might be just enough to avoid a bad trip. The music reverberates like what he interprets to be the sounds of labor and love. He feels the composition all the way to his very bones, filled with a kind of newborn mirth. And to the enveloping tastes of the sounds, the organ squarely positioned in his chest thrums in unison to its orchestrated march. He lays the phone at his side and now swept into the tidings of melody and vistas of sound. He is restful. He thinks to himself – maybe next week.

_Journal Entry_

_Tomorrow, I start a job at a small café. It is nestled in a small pocket of suburbia, deep in the heart of the township. The neighborhood in which it resides abounds in a reassuring quietude, and it thrums with its familiar sounds and resonances. Sometimes, there is a pervasive silence, like in the dead of night. The gloaming would envelop the boulevards, and the indistinct glow of the moon would peek through the floating nimbuses. Its night sky would be peppered with darkening radiances. God, how they gleam. The firmament would envelop the trinkets in its familiar nightfall. The Dipper stove. Other times, my eardrums would be besieged with the sounds of children enacting their habitual crusades. They would frolic in the streets and behave in their familiar ways, drunkenly springing about in their recognizable manners. They would rip the verdure from the ground and would stain their clothes in blotches and streaks of green. Just a year ago, these panoramas of suburbia I saw before me would instead be interchanged with colorless walls. I would sit at my cubicle, uninspired by the dreary enclosure. I would engage in savorless exchanges with unhappy looking coworkers as they harped over spreadsheets and month-end financials. I stopped by the café earlier today. It was colored in mauves and crimsons of all shades. The smell of espresso filled the air, and in my midst were the thrumming of everyday lives in full bloom. Jazz softly played in the background, and I caught my body almost gamboling to the music. I met with my manager, and I noticed the tattoo on her hand. She seemed only a little bit older than me. She was pleasant, cheerful, and full of both life and energy. I handed her some documents that were requested and left with a quasar in my chest. I noticed something when I went outside. There were a flock of fledgling birds, and they chirruped and warbled in the distance. A group of recent hatchlings were all perched upon the branches of the tree, and I studied them closely. As I watched the birds resting upon the boughs, a sense of anticipation welled up inside me. Tomorrow, a new chapter begins—one far removed from the stark walls and hollow exchanges of my past. The café, in many respects, seemed to promise something deeper and more human than a life of financial security alone could ever bring. The hatchlings warbled again - their petite bodies trembling with life and possibility. Perhaps, I thought, we were not so different - perched here, on the precipice of something new, ready to take flight into uncharted skies._

…

It is next week now. It slowly crept up on him - time. The lost time that creeps up on us all. He didn’t check his phone that Thursday – he was busy working and had been running errands all late afternoon. He’s a barista at a café in town and he takes the morning shift. As the day uncurtained the night, gloamings of light peppered his visage through the dotted gaps in the bedroom shutters. He heard the other day that today was supposed to be busier than usual – for some reason or another – he didn’t know. He was a tad late, but he managed to be there before anyone noticed, before any customers could complain. He opened the store and went about his routine. Next to the coffee station, he grabbed the portafilter from the grouphead, but noticed the night shift had mistakenly left (or intentionally, he could never tell) residue in its basket. He dispensed with the gunk already consumed and purged the deposit into the knock box. Then it was time to dial in. Gathering the grated beans in the portafilter basket, he used the tamp to compress the grounds into a mush. Of course, he used his body weight; using your wrist to perform a thrusting motion can injure it over the long term, as any skilled barista would know. And as he pulled the shot to make the ristretto, he could already taste the sour in his nostrils.

This blend in particular had notes of cherry, so an incorrect grind size or extraction time could, occasionally, overpower the senses with a fruitful acerbity. He adjusted the settings and pulled another shot. This one was a delight, the perfect balance of bitter and tart. At this point you want to adjust the water flow. And so, he did. For ristretto, the ideal is about 20 milliliters or 0.7 ounces. He goes to pull the shot once more. 19 seconds. 20 seconds. 21 seconds. The extraction took the perfect amount of time. Any longer, and it would taste more like mere espresso. Ristretto style is characterized by a particular intensity. A more concentrated experience than that of espresso. Left to pull for more time and the flavor profile might have been lost to the winds. He slurps it in a rather uncivilized fashion, but he craves the hit. He wants to feel on edge, as if he is on the precipice of something grandeur. He wants to careen toward the sublime_._ A Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog. And a morning ristretto, indeed, does the trick. Mixed with an Adderall, he has thus become a Caesar, and for this small moment, he might exclaim: I came, I saw, I conquered.

_…_

My greatest struggle lies in the gap between desiring to express what lies within me, and the apparent inability to do so. It is not a flaw; it is part of the grand design. Part of the limits of our world are the limits of language.<sup><sup>[\[2\]](#endnote-2)</sup></sup> Change often begins in the mind’s eye. It often starts with a wish, a reverie, or a dream. These dreams operate, most often, at the level of the subconscious. These are the latent desires, sublimated into, ultimately, _mythologies_. In the most straightforward fashion, I might convey that what I wish to reflect upon is not absence itself, but instead the _presence_ of absence. To illustrate this, I use a tool we are all familiar with. This device I call the _Mythologies of the Heart_ - the formless narratives, the wishful reveries, the tender imaginings that tell us who we were, who we are, and who we might become – _Mythologies_ that also might aid us in understanding the overwhelming sense of absence or loss in our lives. The inherent discomfitures of human existence.

A mythology here is rendered in a particular sense. They are the fictions that embody, in particular, traces of existential entanglements. For these mythologies are the stories we fabricate about where we are from, who we are, and where we are going. These are myths because they are _traditional_ in one’s historical dimension, _allegorical_ in one’s present dimension, and _imaginary_ in one’s future dimension. In all of its manifestations across time and space, the mythological, then, is simply what has not been believed to be possible. The "_Mythologies of the Heart_" unfold across three interwoven dimensions that give depth and dynamism to our personal and collective narratives. In their _traditional_, historical dimension, these mythologies draw from the past, shaping our understanding of where we come from through inherited cultural tropes like the "happy ending" or the "American Dream," which frame our aspirations within a lineage or a _telos_ of tradition. In the _allegorical_, present dimension, they serve as metaphors that help us interpret our current experiences; we illustrate this with the exploration of _non-places_—airports, highways, waiting rooms, and eventually, the heart itself.

These transient, liminal spaces become sites where we construct meaning through symbolic narratives, even amidst dislocation. Looking forward, in their _imaginary_, or _future_ dimension, these mythologies project our hopes and fears into visions of what could be, resonating with conceptions of Heaven or Valhalla, where dreams and stories act as tools for survival, cultivating "Elysiums" and "fortressed Zions" that offer comfort, however illusory or empirically unprovable they may ultimately be. Together, these dimensions weave together a tapestry of longing and possibility, grounding us in history, animating our present, and guiding us toward futures yet unwritten.

In Kafkaesque fashion, then, “the nonexistent is whatever we have insufficiently desired.” We move beyond Barthes’ “Mythologies” which focused merely on the ideological functions of myths in everyday life.<sup><sup>[\[3\]](#endnote-3)</sup></sup> We frame myth not merely as an ideological construct but as an essential existential structure – one that determines what gets actualized and delimits the boundaries of what is possible. This links Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of _desire_ in Anti-Oedipus. But rather than arguing that desire is only productive, we link _desire_ to the formation of reality _itself.<sup><sup>[\[4\]](#endnote-4)</sup></sup>_ Desire can now be seen as a _material_ rather than merely a _discursive_ force, intersecting with New Materialisms, Object-Oriented Ontology and, particularly, Critical Posthumanism and its relational ontologies<sup><sup>[\[5\]](#endnote-5)</sup></sup>. The myth, or the mythology, is not “just” a story we tell ourselves or a fiction that is fabricated but a structural condition of what we can imaginatively conceive of - forces that guide the actualization of the historical, the real, and the possible.

For it was through these _Mythologies_ that I gained the ability to withstand the pain that ensued through events and their many thereafters. These _Mythologies_ are not an escape from reality but, rather, are maps for understanding and expressing the _non-places_ within us. They are the invincible summer that persists within us, despite the looming winter of sorrow<sup><sup>[\[6\]](#endnote-6)</sup></sup>, the never-ending struggle to make ends meet, and the feeling of living in a land or a body that is both familiar and, at times, foreign. But what does this presence look like? The presence of something that does not, in some ways, exist?

It does not display itself as an act of confession, but it is instead its own subversion. Not an act of concealment, but it's perpetual unconcealment. Not a memoir, but a diary of thought. An offering made in absence. It is neither a total emptying of the viscera, nor a cleansing of its entrails. It is not a culture of transparency but a cult of secrecy whose order exists not to hand down its dogmas but to instead be forgotten. Its rites of passage are encoded in an unfamiliar tongue, locked in a trunk, forgotten amidst the overgrowth of Lisbon’s ruins.<sup><sup>[\[7\]](#endnote-7)</sup></sup> We further possess contradictory propensities, but in our case, for love, for the unrequited, for the seemingly unattainable. I have come to see this, not as personal ailment, but as a symptom of perhaps something greater within me. Something greater within all of us. In this sense, it is as if we are within a familiar home upon a foreign soil where each day feels unchanged, yet everything shifts around us.

The rooms inside – you see that they are all the same. The windows remain in their familiar spaces. The wood is still freshly lacquered and is dotted and dashed with its familiar decorum. But you notice something is off. The dim light peering from the vestibule is peculiar. The room, as you see it around you, is peppered with jutting slants of dusk. The light peeking through the venetian blinds bend and contort the shapes in the most profane arrangements. Are you still home? Or are you somewhere else? You open the door and walk outside, and you do not see your garden, but you instead see a void. An ever-expanding oblivion.

You step into it and there is an invisible surface, of sorts. You see the faint glow in the distance. You take a step. Then another. You saunter toward it – the whole motion - starting from the back of your heel to the tip of your toes in half a gyration. Slowly. One after the other. A heat abounds within you, the warmth of a lipless kiss. Its effervescence bubbles toward the surface, carrying with it the most cherished remembrances, the most intimate of reveries, your most sacred thoughts. But suddenly you realize the trap. Shouldn’t you have known better? In one fell swoop: A dagger sheathed in a cloak. A siren song. A Judas' kiss. The light vanishes. Where are you?

And so, I return, yet again, to the ritual. The ink hesitates, the ballpoint remains mute. I attempt to write. I would hold my pen in hand and scribble a few lines. I would cross them out. I would write more. I would rip a page. I would stare at my keyboard in front of me, and it would stare back. But now, of all places, I am writing at the kitchen counter. My mind whirring - awake and stirring. And at this time of night, I only see their outlines: the contours of memories. The faint shadows of impressions. And as my fingers scurry across the keyboard, I try, for a moment, to conjure the act once more. The forbidden summoning. A necromancy of what has long been dead within me. And as my pulse thrums and courses through the veins of life, the more I apprehend how even the greatest of nirvanas can cease with the most dispirited of departures.

We all possess a graveyard of musings in decay. A sepulcher filled to the brim with the wishful fantasies of inner children. These engrossments are instead subsumed by an altar. A tribune of sacrifice fitting even for the costliest martyrdoms. This blood pact would be an _Animus_ in exchange for the deepest desires of the soul - the creature comforts of mundane tranquility. To some, vapidity and cliché would be the substance of its contents. But to most, especially today, such a life is buttressed and bolstered. Banal, yet merry. An Eden from which we have not yet been expunged. A fruitful garden. A sanctuary. A humble abode. An Elysium. A Zion. But in the end, merely an enduring illusion. Mirages of an oasis in the desert. A phantasm mistaken for water. A dream mistaken for a waking life. A simulacrum of the Real.<sup><sup>[\[8\]](#endnote-8)</sup></sup>

And though trapped in simulacra, every now and then, I find myself driving through Princeton, delivering food to make ends meet. Through the fogged window, I would catch glimpses of the grand homes nestled among the pine. The crispness of Bluegrass lawns and the adornments of the University Chapel emerged like visions from another world. Blair Hall stood valiantly in the skyline, basking in all the majesty of its grand design – the Collegiate Gothic solemnity being the zenith of suburban tranquility.<sup><sup>[\[9\]](#endnote-9)</sup></sup> The longer I contemplated the busts and the sculpted buttresses, the more spellbound I became. I was caught in a Medusa’s gaze — not petrifying merely the body but instead casting the very soul into disquiet. A noiseless aching stirs within me, neither paralyzed nor freed, but suspended—held in the quiet thrall of awe and estrangement. Beneath its microcosm of magnificence, beneath the _élan vital_ of its ivory towers, lies a world of privilege—vivid, ungraspable. A realm I can observe but never fully inhabit. Its beauty is a quiet reproach to my unmoored existence. I have, at times, felt myself part of this world. I’ve dined in its restaurants, shared a quiet moment helping an elderly woman across the street, and wandered the University Museum, marveling at Bodhisattvas, Hungry Ghosts, and Devas. In the University Museum, I stood before the unyielding eyes of Saints. Their silent gazes, etched in stone, seemed to echo both grace and reproach, the timeless reminder of presence and absence intertwined.

But at the same time, in those moments, and for reasons I cannot fully articulate, I felt both present and absent. My body was there, moving through the spaces, seeing and breathing – but as though I were an apparition. I was there, yet I lingered elsewhere, unable to enter. Like an insect skittering across the wall at a wedding reception. Like a janitor slipping from the ballroom to light a cigarette before the real work begins. I was present, yet absent. I was interminably Other. A Lovecraftian conjuration scouring the ethers for a flickering of warmth yet holding back for fear of being scorched. A labyrinth, teeming with the echoes of whispers and shadows. A Body without Organs, searching to fill what is empty within.<sup><sup>[\[10\]](#endnote-10)</sup></sup> Schrödinger’s Gadfly flitting between presence and absence.<sup><sup>[\[11\]](#endnote-11)</sup></sup>

To help illustrate these ideas and sentiments, I will turn to a theory and concept I hope will be illuminating to the intellect. In 1995, French anthropologist Marc Augé introduced the very important concept of “Non-Places” that we will be expanding upon here.<sup><sup>[\[12\]](#endnote-12)</sup></sup> _Non-places_ are rooted in the notion that such spaces are characterized by their functional purpose, as well as their lack of shared identity, history, or emotional entanglements. To Augé, they are spaces of transience where individuals remain anonymous and are limited in their ability to establish lasting social bonds. Augé situates non-places<sup><sup>[\[13\]](#endnote-13)</sup></sup> within Supermodernity—an era marked by acceleration, excess, and the erosion of lasting social bonds. These are spaces of anonymization: airports we pass through without imprint, highways that blur into the peripheries of our journeys, waiting rooms where time folds into itself after an act of violence or terror.

Within these zones, subjectivity is diminished, historical rootedness effaced. He distinguishes between the two kinds of spaces: _places_ and _non-places_ through their relationship to identity, history, and relationality. Traditional places are imbued with meaning: they are relational, historical, and culturally inscribed, whereas non-places are the inverse, defined by atomization, absence and fluidity. Augé emphasizes the emptiness of non-places, describing them as zones where the subject is reduced to a solitary traveler or courted consumer. Interactions are mediated not through human relationships but through signs, texts, and protocols: boarding passes, security instructions, advertisements, triages and waiting rooms. The non-place, in Augé's framing, is thus defined, at the core, by the absence of connection.

2. Ludwig Wittgenstein asserts in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus that "the limits of my language mean the limits of my world," emphasizing the primacy of language in shaping our understanding of reality. For Wittgenstein, language is not merely a tool for communication but a framework that defines the boundaries of what can be thought and expressed. Consequently, anything beyond the realm of language is also beyond the realm of conceptualization and meaning. See Ludwig Wittgenstein, _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_, translated by C.K. Ogden, Routledge, 1922, proposition 5.6. [↑](#endnote-ref-2)

3. Roland Barthes’ _Mythologies_ (trans. Annette Lavers, New York: Hill and Wang, 1972) analyzes how everyday objects and cultural phenomena become ideological myths, reinforcing dominant social structures. However, while Barthes focuses on demystifying these ideological functions, our approach extends beyond mere ideological critique to explore myths as dynamic, affective, and ontological structures that shape perception and lived experience. For a perspective that similarly moves beyond ideological analysis, see Jean Baudrillard, _Simulacra and Simulation_ (trans. Sheila Faria Glaser, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1994), which examines the disappearance of the real into self-referential signs. [↑](#endnote-ref-3)

4. Deleuze and Guattari conceptualize _desire_ as a productive, machinic force that resists repression and produces flows within social and economic structures. However, rather than focusing solely on desire as a productive mechanism, we extend this notion to argue that desire is not just generative but constitutive of reality itself—shaping ontological structures and determining what is (or is not) actualized within a given field of experience. This resonates with speculative philosophies that explore the co-creation of being and becoming through desire. [↑](#endnote-ref-4)

5. Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) is a philosophical movement that challenges anthropocentric perspectives by asserting that all objects—whether human, nonhuman, natural, or artificial—exist independently of human perception. Coined by Graham Harman, OOO argues that objects have their own realities, relations, and agency beyond their interactions with humans. This framework rejects correlationism (the idea that existence is always tied to human thought) and instead posits a "flat ontology" where no entity holds ontological priority over another.

6. A nod to when Camus reflects on the resilience of the human spirit in his essay “Return to Tipasa,” writing, “In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.” This line encapsulates Camus’s existential philosophy, emphasizing the enduring strength and hope that persists even in the face of despair.

7. Kirsch, in his article "Fernando Pessoa’s Disappearing Act," examines the enigmatic nature of Fernando Pessoa, a Portuguese poet and novelist known for his use of heteronyms — distinct literary personas each with their own style, worldview, and biography. Kirsch highlights how Pessoa’s literary fragmentation reflects a deliberate erasure of a unified self, allowing him to explore multiple perspectives on identity, existence, and creativity. This act of "disappearing" through his heteronyms complicates traditional notions of authorship and individuality. See Adam Kirsch, "_Fernando Pessoa’s Disappearing Act,"_ _The New Yorker_, 4 Sept. 2017. [↑](#endnote-ref-7)

8. I mean _especially today_ as it emphasizes the state of the current _milieu_ and the collective tendency to valorize stability, predictability, and continuity. In an age characterized by uncertainty and rapid change — driven by technological advancement, economic precarity, and poly-crises — there is an increased cultural investment in the ideal of a tranquil, secure existence. This is reflected in the pervasive glorification of domestic stability, consumer comforts, and curated lifestyles in media and advertising, which create sentiments of fulfillment and meaning. These might detract from questions and the inherent flow of human life, rendering such pursuits a "simulacrum of the Real," as described by Baudrillard. See Jean Baudrillard. _Simulacra and Simulation_. Translated by Sheila Faria Glaser, University of Michigan Press, 1994. [↑](#endnote-ref-8)

9. Collegiate Gothic, an architectural style popularized in American university campuses during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, draws inspiration from the medieval Gothic architecture of European universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. Designed to evoke tradition, intellectual gravitas, and prestige, the style is characterized by pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and ornate stone detailing. In this context, structures like Blair Hall and the University Chapel embody a particular aesthetic while reflecting the wealth and aspirations of the institution. [↑](#endnote-ref-9)

10. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari introduce the concept of the "body without organs" (BwO) as a metaphorical construct representing a body stripped of organization, hierarchy, and imposed structure. It challenges traditional notions of identity and the organism by emphasizing potentiality, fluidity, and desiring-production. The BwO is not a literal body but an open system resisting stratification and facilitating the free flow of intensities and desires. See Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, _A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia_, translated by Brian Massumi, University of Minnesota Press, 1987. [↑](#endnote-ref-10)

11. The phrase "Schrödinger’s Gadfly" evokes a fusion of two distinct philosophical and scientific ideas. Schrödinger’s Cat, a famous thought experiment in quantum mechanics, illustrates the paradox of superposition, where a system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. Socrates, often referred to as Athens’ “gadfly,” symbolizes a disruptive presence, persistently questioning and challenging norms and beliefs. Combining these concepts, “Schrödinger’s Gadfly” might suggest a state of paradoxical existence — simultaneously present and disruptive, yet unobserved or marginalized. In this context, it reflects a sentiment of being both within and apart from the spaces one inhabits, embodying a role that is simultaneously intrusive and invisible, questioning but constrained by their own alterity.

13. More specifically, Marc Augé defines _non-places_ as transient spaces that lack the relational, historical, and identity-driven significance of traditional “places.” These spaces, such as airports, highways, and shopping malls, are designed for functionality and anonymity, facilitating movement and consumption rather than fostering connections or rootedness. In this context, _non-places_ become emblematic of the disconnection and excess characteristic of contemporary Supermodernity, where individuals navigate spaces devoid of personal or communal attachment. _See Note 10._ [↑](#endnote-ref-13)
