## Specters of the Heart

In the heart’s ventricles, we hold traces<sup><sup>[\[53\]](#endnote-53)</sup></sup> of loves lost and imagined, desires unfulfilled, and connections forged only to be severed. Derrida’s concept of “traces” is not merely a vestige or remnant of something past, but an essential part of the process of meaning-making in the present. For Derrida, every sign, every element of language, contains within it traces of other meanings, other contexts – it is never fully present in itself. This notion challenged the traditional binary oppositions that have so dominated Western thought, such as presence and absence, speech and writing, or form and content. Instead, Derrida proposed that meaning is always deferred, always in a state of becoming, never fully arriving at a conclusion.

In the context of the heart, these traces manifest as the echoes of our past loves and losses, the imprints of relationships that shape our current experiences. The heart, in this view, becomes a palimpsest, a layered text where new inscriptions are made over the faint lines of old ones. Each new emotion, each new connection, carries with it the unseen, the unspoken residuals of what came before. These traces are not just reminders of past experiences; they actively inform and transform our present, weaving a complex tapestry of memory and desire.

The traces in our hearts are the silent witnesses to our joys and sorrows, the invisible threads that bind us to our past and propel us towards our future. It is a spectral presence – a Hauntology<sup><sup>[\[54\]](#endnote-54)</sup></sup> - that ever-materializes into the present, reminding us of the fluid and transient nature of the heart. In recognizing these traces, we acknowledge both the continuities and disjunctures of our Affective existence, the ways in which our past is never fully past but always intertwined with our present and future.

Traces invite us to embrace the multiplicity of meanings, the layered complexities of our emotions. They challenge us to see beyond the surface, to delve into the depths of our hearts where the resonances of past experiences linger. In doing so, we come to understand that our hearts, much like non-places, are sites of perpetual transformation, spaces where the boundaries of time and self continually blur and reconfigure. In this intricate dance of presence and absence, of memory and anticipation, we find the true essence of our emotional lives. The heart, as a repository of traces, becomes a testament to the ineffable power of love as a site of resistance, a beacon amidst the flux and flow of existence. It is in these traces that we discover the profound interconnectedness of our shared humanity, the delicate threads that weave together the fabric of our lives.

The heart, in sum, is the transient locus where memory and emotion collide in a cacophony of ensembles. It is a space where time stretches and compresses, where the past is perpetually replayed, and alternate futures are perpetually longed for. Just as we pass through non-places without leaving a trace, love passes through the heart, leaving only the outlines of its presence: the scent of a familiar perfume lingering in the air, the touch of a hand that still feels warm in the mind’s eye, the echoing sound of a familiar voice. These impressions can be as vivid as they are cursory. The heart is not an archive. It is a non-place for what cannot be fully grasped or held without a Mythology to sustain.

Mythologies of the Heart, however, like all Mythologies, can betray us. They might promise jubilant resolution, life fulfillment, or otherworldly transcendence. But often they deliver something far more complex and equally as painful: longing, disappointment, and, at times, the deepest of despair. Yet, even in this betrayal, there is a strangeness of beauty (for as Francis Bacon once denoted there is no beauty without some element of strangeness<sup><sup>[\[55\]](#endnote-55)</sup></sup>). The unfulfilled Mythology holds within it the possibility of something higher — a potential of love not yet imagined, a connection not yet realized, a latent self not yet unearthed. A reason to live.<sup><sup>[\[56\]](#endnote-56)</sup></sup> In this sense, Mythologies of the Heart, then, are not blasé indulgences for a childish pastime but are the necessary conditions of lived experience, community, and belonging.

Just like the otherworldliness of cathedrals or the gallant friezes that paint mausoleums, _Mythologies of the Heart_ are artifacts through which we use art and representation to manipulate the symbolic order, folding the world into itself. Each word embraces the threaded liminality of our perceptions and the ensuing explosion of Affects and Percepts<sup><sup>[\[57\]](#endnote-57)</sup></sup> this creates for the reader. These Mythologies show us that the Heart is not a location but a journey (tell me: can there be a journey without a journeyman?), it is not a feeling in-the-moment but an unbroken tether, a perpetual movement through the panoramic vistas of our inner worlds and the shared Earth that take up space within our lifeworlds.

Like the non-places we inhabit, the _Mythologies of the Heart_ are thresholds — openings to new possibilities and uncharted territories of the _Existential Animus_. These Mythologies are born where absence meets presence and where the penultimate chapter always orbits in one’s midst, tidally locked in suspense. These Mythologies are the effervescence of an unwritten book. They manifest themselves in the spaces between words, the moment the chapter ends, and one reflects - when the last word on the last page has been subsumed and you are left in awe, where ideas marinate in the mind. They are the quiescent narratives we craft to make sense of what has touched us but cannot be expressed. Or for what should never be expressed. The lives we didn’t want, but we received. Like a moon in a dewdrop. A flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream.<sup><sup>[\[58\]](#endnote-58)</sup></sup> The endings we asked for, and received not only that but more.

_Journal Entry - Jan. 11<sup>th</sup>, 2025_

_In my work, my aim is to consistently uphold subjectivity – the ways in which we experience and perceive the world – to the same esteem that we hold objectivity, the notion that we shan’t be influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering representing facts. Objectivity is an epistemic virtue, meaning it is a quality or trait that contributes to an individual’s ability to acquire, maintain, and use knowledge in particular ways – in normative manners. Historically, and even to this day, we value key attributes of objectivity such as impartiality, detachment, replicability and uniformity. So, while objectivity aims to minimize bias (notice the mathematical characterization here), subjectivity acknowledges that our individual perspectives can contribute valuable insights. Some vital aspects of this mode of thinking are the embracing of personal insight, emotional intelligence, contextual awareness, and reflective equilibrium, which is to say, to balance insight and evidence to alter both beliefs and judgments._

_In many contexts, the virtue of objectivity is upheld as an exemplar to aspire towards. Fields such as science, law as well as journalism and mass media emphasize objectivity due to either structural or path-dependent factors that emphasize the need for factual rigor. But what if this view, although well intentioned, is mistaken, in some ways? As we have been shown through the postmodernist movement, the aim of separating the observer from what is being observed might have been a somewhat futile endeavor especially in the sciences, humanities and arts. Economics, according to Merriam Webster is “a social science concerned chiefly with the description and analysis of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.” The field underwent a notable “crisis of confidence” during the 2008 Financial Crisis, from which the field, in the public’s sentiments, has yet to recover from._

_Another related idea, the notion of “separation of powers”, particularly in the United States, has come under question as perpetual gridlock and political polarization is at an all-time high. The notion comes from Enlightenment era epistemic values – values regarding the theory of knowledge. As a refresher, the Enlightenment was a period of intellectual growth in 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century European civilization, whereby an emphasis on reason, individual rights and the critique of monarchical power were paramount. This tradition of thought, particularly influenced by thinkers such as Locke, Montesquieu, and Rousseau, heavily influenced the 1878 Philadelphia Convention, which was duly inspired by these Enlightenment principles. Particularly the separation of powers, checks and balances on government, and private property rights. It is an understatement to say that these ideas were profoundly revolutionary and transformative for its time, however, there have been emerging foundational cracks in the artifice that have become impossible to ignore._

_Political gridlock in Washington, as well as other institutional wicked problems (which are complex issues that are difficult or impossible to solve due to incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements) such as the carceral state, the military-industrial complex, mass surveillance by Big Tech, “Too Big to Fail” Investment Banks, Big Media and their manufacturing consent , the climate crisis in the time of the Anthropocene, agribusiness and Big Food, the commoditization of real estate and little league teams by private equity firms, the cost of living crisis and the financialization of the necessities of life, as well as the higher education tuition bubble to name a few, have seemed to be problems that are insurmountable._

_Modernity and its narrow focus on rationality have permeated nearly every domain of social life, using objective measures to classify, organize and herd us into various hierarchies and schemas of classification that objectify the subject. These systems render us as Pavlovian Arrangements – objects that act due to mechanisms that condition behavior, responding to structural incentives such as compensation packages, healthcare benefits, childcare subsidies and retirement provisions. This is the point where I elaborate on our counter-revolution: the subjective turn. In art and literature, for example, subjectivity is the core of creative expression._

_Art thrives on a multiplicity perspectives, emotions and interpretations (polyvocality) – particularly machinations from those relegated to the peripheries of society -allowing for diversity of thought and personal connection that could only have been gleaned from a minoritarian perspective due to their very situatedness. In ethics and morality, subjective experience (as opposed to, say, economic or financial metrics) informs our moral judgments. Empathy, for example, is inherently subjective but is crucial for ethical reasoning and navigating interpersonal relationships._

_The societal tendency to prioritize objectivity arises from its association with universality, neutrality, and as a result, fairness. It is often seen as a way to transcend personal bias and achieve common understanding. However, there is a growing recognition that subjectivity should be seen as not opposed to, but rather complimentary to objective standards. This idea ties directly, in one way, to the carceral state and the methodologies and dominant approaches of the United States Supreme Court. The late Justice Antonin Scalia promoted what he termed a “textualist” approach to statutory interpretation – focusing on the plain meaning of the text as understood at the time of its drafting – which epitomizes a latent commitment to objectivity as a virtue._

_Justice Elena Kagan’s famous remark “We are all textualists now,” acknowledges the current dominance of this framework in contemporary legal thought and jurisprudence, even among jurists who might differ ideologically or methodologically from Justice Scalia. But while textualism emphasizes objectivity, legal interpretation is inherently subjective in several ways. Judges must, for example, exercise contextual judgement by determining what the “plain meaning” of a text was in its given historical context. This involves subjective considerations regarding which sources to consult and which evidence to prioritize. Furthermore, applying laws written in broad terms requires a level of personal creativity and judgment that resists the tautening pull of purely objective standards of reasoning._

_Finally, the law does not operate in a vacuum. Subjective considerations, like equity, morality, and empathy often play a crucial role in shaping decisions – judgements that more often than not push against textualist rigidity in favor of what Justice Scalia opined as “purposivism”, a legal theory that suggests a court's statutory interpretation should reflect the statute's original purpose, to prevent judicial overreach. The American Legal System and its many subsystems and various assemblies often overvalue detached “objective” reasoning while undervaluing relational and experiential insights. Greater attention to subjective narrativization (e.g., the lived experiences of those presented in the form of amicus briefs) can make law more just, fighting against objectivity’s central in creating the growing carceral state that clearly privileges retributive theories of justice, which are based on objective measures, over rehabilitative theories, which stress the contextual aspects of deviance and criminality._

_Approaches like critical legal studies and feminist jurisprudence (particularly, the Feminist Politics of the Body) can help resist the notion of the objective neutrality of the law, highlighting the social, economic, and political entanglements that shape the American legal system as a whole. Resisting the emphasis on objectivity does not mean rejecting it entirely, but rather recognizing its limitations and integrating subjective human values into our interpretive processes at both institutional and systemic levels. An “Affective Turn” (building towards a Transjective Turn in posthumanism, which will be discussed later) would encourage and recognize the true value of subjectivity as a systematically legitimate form of inquiry and understanding. In the Sciences, we can reevaluate the observer’s role, value experiential and anecdotal evidence alongside empirical data and prioritize, for instance, indigenous ways of knowing and the complexities of their respective knowledge systems._

_In the social sciences, particularly empiricist streams such as economics and law, we could explicitly foreground individual a collective lived experiences as essential to understanding human behavior and societal structures. We can shift emphasis to ethnography, narrative inquiry, and participatory action research, which centers narrative storytelling and embodied experience. Social Scientists, especially those hailing from elite institutions and a privileged pedigree, can acknowledge their own positionality – how their identity, background, and beliefs influence their research – and making this explicit in their research output, such as papers, manuscripts, book chapters and conference proceedings._

_We can begin to embrace frameworks such as phenomenology, hermeneutics, and postcolonial theory, interpreting the world through personal, historical, and cultural lenses that have been systemically undervalued. In this vein, we might finally move away from universal generalizations to embrace complexity, context, and multiplicity in subjective behavior and cultural practices. In the Arts, we might begin to value deeply personal and introspective art that resists commodification. We might challenge the primacy of the notion of a Western Canon, recognizing diverse, marginalized, or unconventional perspectives as equally insightful and valuable as hegemonic purviews._

_We might blur the boundaries between other fields, resisting reductionistic specialization, encouraging artists, writers, and scholars of all strides to be universal in the traditional sense of the university – artist-philosophers, poet-scientists, or dramaturg-anthropologists. We might engage in a Politics of the Imagination, where every voice has the potential to become a Foucault. That every writer can become a Kafka, Mishima, or Achebe. A Subjective Turn, in this way, can pave the way to more ethical, Posthuman forms of praxis, where we see ourselves not merely as isolated subjects but as collective assemblages. Interdependent communities that co-exist, co-habitate, and co-create with both one another and the environment. A world where we are not just neighbors, but old friends. A world where we might be, finally, judged by both what is full of and the content of our character._

<sup>…</sup>

Derrida’s main critique of _logocentrism_ – a system of rigid binaries - revolves around the notion that Western philosophy has historically privileged speech over writing, where speech is considered a direct expression of meaning and writing as mere representation of speech-acts.<sup><sup>[\[59\]](#endnote-59)</sup></sup> Derrideans argue that this hierarchy is flawed because it assumes that meaning is fixed and stable. They posit that both speech and writing are forms of symbolic meaning-making that are subject to their own respective codes of interpretation and evolutionary trajectories.<sup><sup>[\[60\]](#endnote-60)</sup></sup>

In this light, the Mythologies of the Heart bring to the center the _Animus_ to this _Event_, this “counter-reformation” of sorts. The Mythologies, as I have described, are both sanctuaries and prisons. They are singularities in superposition that resist instrumental ways-of-knowing and the assemblages of control that entrap us in their paradoxical embrace. They are the threads that weave through our lives, offering both solace and challenge, demanding that we confront the unseen and the unspoken within ourselves.

Mythologies of the Heart help encapsulate the zeitgeist of our _posthuman_<sup><sup>[\[61\]](#endnote-61)</sup></sup>, hypermodern condition. A reality of transience, exclusion, and absence, where reality and unreality are blurred by the virtual, by the technological, by the ecosophical. These Mythologies delve deeply into the ways society erases presence and reconstructs narratives to curry favor from the powerful at the expense of the Other. In prototypical “nonplaces” conceived of by Augé - airports, highways, restaurants, amusement parks, and waiting rooms – spaces are characterized by their functionality rather than a coherent cultural and historical identity.

These Augéan nonplaces are designed for transition rather than habitation, dispelling and scattering rather than accepting and gathering. They exemplify the logical conclusion of Modernity’s _Gesellschaft_ <sup><sup>[\[62\]](#endnote-62)</sup></sup> society and how it renders its subjects. The anonymity, the commodified reification<sup><sup>[\[63\]](#endnote-63)</sup></sup> enforced by such environments chip away at personal identity, retroactively reducing people and public spaces to _Pavlovian arrangements_<sup><sup>[\[64\]](#endnote-64)</sup></sup> – mere assemblies within the totalizing _Machine_.

Derrida's critique of logocentrism, then, highlights how traditional Western philosophy has marginalized writing as subordinate to speech, thereby enforcing a hierarchy that privileges direct expression over what is deemed “mere representation.” Is this not Western society’s tendency to privilege certain forms of presence and visibility over others? Are one’s gazes not ordered in accordance with the stature of or magnetism from which the observance emits? In the same way that writing was perceived as a mere shadow of speech, are not individuals who inhabit non-places seen as specters — present, but unnoticed and unacknowledged? They are the silent majority that is too apathetic to vote. The “basket of deplorables”<sup><sup>[\[65\]](#endnote-65)</sup></sup> that revel in a Hobbesian reversal<sup><sup>[\[66\]](#endnote-66)</sup></sup>. The Left that sermonizes the notion of “choosing the lesser evil”. The coveted minoritarians that are too divided for collective resistance.

_Mythologies_ confront the emerging erasure of these marginalized narratives from the totality of the political spectrum by boldly inhabiting unseen spaces with revolutionary vitality. These _Mythologies_ turn absence into a rich soil for creation, empowering the unnoticed and the invisible to reclaim their voices and stories—each one worthy of being told, heard, and affirmed. At once sanctuary and prison, these Mythologies provide refuge from the peering eyes of corporate surveillance technologies while simultaneously laying bare the chains that bind us to its mechanical apparatus.

_“To be too acutely conscious is a disease, a real, honest-to-goodness disease” <sup><sup>[\[67\]](#endnote-67)</sup></sup>_

In resisting instrumental ways-of-knowing that are totalizing in form, _Mythologies of the Heart_ assert the validity of experiences must not conform to majoritarian paradigms. They are an ode to the liminal and the in-between, to the peripheries where static binaries dissolve, and where emergent possibilities actualize. Mythologies, then, not only critique mechanisms of erasure in ways that Non-Mythologies, including pure academic philosophy, by itself, cannot. _Mythologies_ instead propose alternative configurations of Presence. A counter-counter-genealogy. Not a negation of negation. Nor a _Aufhebung<sup><sup>[\[68\]](#endnote-68)</sup></sup>_ in Hegelian terms. But an affirmative cartography – a map that is inherently nomadic, ever becoming, and inherently resistant to the forces that seek to render its collective voice concealed.

It is typically quipped that “what is unseen amounts to nothing.” <sup><sup>[\[69\]](#endnote-69)</sup></sup> Yet more fundamentally, _all that is unseen sustains what is seen_—the invisible scaffolding of laborers, dreamers, and desirers that upholds the visible concrete world. This is not, as I have stated in the beginning of this chapter, the absence of presence, but the presence of absence: the whispers of histories untold, the shadows of silenced voices, and the reverberations of truths obscured by dominant frameworks, the counter-genealogies. In this way, _Mythologies_ reclaim the unseen as a site of power—a grounding where new imaginaries take root, refusing to be nullified by the tyranny of visibility. Here, silence becomes articulation, and what is felt, intuited, and ineffable reaches its fullest possible expression.

_A monk asked Master Joshu, "What is Zen?"  
Joshu remained silent. The monk asked, "Why do you not speak?"  
Joshu replied, "If I spoke, would it be Zen? <sup><sup>[\[70\]](#endnote-70)</sup></sup>_

_Journal Entry, Undated_

_This year, I decided I am going to take my writing more seriously. I decided that I am going to take myself more seriously. That I am going to act upon the congruences in my heart rather than the sensibilities of the intellect. Rumination is a jester who beguiles you into certainty. It devises its many plans, its varied conjurations, and it reassures you that the future is certain. That it is finally within your fingers’ grasp. This year, I instead will practice the art of resignation. I will be like a ship that has departed from the marina. I will become the vessel, and its sails will take me hither or thither. Instead of yearning for Atlantis, I will become it. I will allow the sails to take me to the furthest reaches of the Atlantic. Perhaps I will kiss the lips of an iceberg, or I will succumb to the torrent of the seas. But I will have perished on a grand adventure._

_My remains will sink to the bottomless nadirs of those shadowy waters. I will be submerged in obscurity, but from that darkness will emerge a valuable story. A Mythology that will live on long after I am gone. A memento for what I believed to be true, for what I loved, for the things I had lost and the many things I gained as a result. A puny, inexhaustible voice that echoes from the void. The Mythologies of my heart. For I have important things to say – as we all do. We all possess within us folklores, legends and epics that are worth both telling and retelling. Within us are vast canvases of thought, galaxies titillating with the temerities of love, loss, and newborn mirth. It is not that this year will be worth remembering, for all years are worth their many moments of tender recollection. But rather, this year will be a year that cannot be disremembered. It will be, not a stain, but a mark – a sign, an indication that I exist, that I am alive, that I think. A signal toward Atlantis. A gentle hint towards treasures of hidden knowledge. An uncovering of myths, legends, and fables. A new Eden, waiting to be discovered._

52. For clarity, what this explores here is the paradoxical nature of love and human experience, suggesting that love transcends tangible spaces and resides in the liminal, the undefined in-between spaces where meaning is not easily grasped. This liminality is described as a shadow, an echo, a fleeting moment that defies articulation but possesses immense power—capable of transformation, creation, abandonment, and destruction. The paradox is heightened by the concept of _Mythologies_. These fictions, such as unexpressed love letters, missed opportunities, and unspoken apologies, shape our lives as much as our concrete experiences. The heart, described as both sanctuary and prison, then, becomes a _non-place_, an ambiguous space where both potentials for connection and alienation coexist, underscoring the tension between presence and absence, between what is felt but not easily named or lived. [↑](#endnote-ref-52)

53. _Traces_ here refer to Jacques Derrida's concept from his theory of deconstruction, where he argues that meaning is never fully present or self-contained. In his work, particularly in _Of Grammatology_, Derrida posits that every sign—whether a word, symbol, or gesture—contains within it traces of other meanings, contexts, and interpretations. These traces are not mere remnants of something past, but essential components of the meaning-making process, as they continuously defer and displace meaning. According to Derrida, meaning is always in a state of becoming, always deferred, and never fully realized or fixed. This idea challenges traditional binary oppositions in Western philosophy, such as presence/absence or speech/writing, suggesting that meaning is fluid and ever evolving, shaped by the interplay of past, present, and future contexts. See Derrida, Jacques. _Writing and Difference_. Translated by Alan Bass, University of Chicago Press, 1978. See also, _Of Grammatology_. Translated by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976. [↑](#endnote-ref-53)

54. _Hauntology_ is a term popularized by Jacques Derrida in his work _Specters of Marx_, referring to the presence of that which is absent, the haunting of the present by lost futures or past events that continue to influence the present. It is the study of how ideas, events, or entities that are no longer tangible or actual still have a lingering effect, creating a spectral presence in contemporary life. Hauntology explores how the past continues to haunt the present, shaping our desires, anxieties, and the ways we understand our futures. In this context, it reflects the emotional and temporal layers that persist within the heart, where past loves, losses, and longings continue to shape current experiences and future possibilities.

57. These are central concepts in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari, particularly in their work _A Thousand Plateaus_. In this context, _affects_ refer to the capacities of bodies or systems to affect or be affected, signifying an encounter with forces that trigger emotional or physical responses. _Percepts_, on the other hand, refer to the sensory or perceptual elements that arise from an interaction with the world, shaping our experience of reality. Both _affects_ and _percepts_ challenge traditional notions of subjectivity and perception, focusing instead on how experiences are constructed through dynamic, relational processes between bodies, forces, and environments. [↑](#endnote-ref-57)

58. This is a famous passage from the _Diamond Sutra_, a key text in Mahayana Buddhism. This passage is used to convey the impermanence and illusory nature of all phenomena, emphasizing the transient, ephemeral quality of existence. It invites the reader to reflect on the illusory nature of attachments and the way that all things, no matter how real they may seem, are ultimately insubstantial, like a moon's reflection in water or the flicker of a lamp in the dark. See _The Diamond Sutra_. Translated by Red Pine, Counterpoint, 2001 [↑](#endnote-ref-58)

59. Derrida’s critique of _logocentrism_ involves deconstructing the hierarchical relationship that positions speech as the privileged mode of communication and writing as its secondary, derivative form. His argument goes beyond simply challenging the binary opposition between speech and writing; he critiques the deeper philosophical assumptions that underpin logocentrism, such as the belief in a "center" of meaning (often equated with speech or the metaphysics of “presence”). Derrida’s work exposes how this system privileges presence and immediate access to meaning while marginalizing absence and difference. In _Of Grammatology_, Derrida argues that writing is not merely a secondary representation of speech but an independent and foundational system in its own right. He contends that meaning is never fully present but always deferred, a process he terms _différance_, which disrupts the very foundations of logocentrism and opens up a more fluid, relational understanding of language.

61. The term _posthuman_ refers to a philosophical and cultural concept that challenges traditional notions of human identity, focusing on the deconstruction of humanism and the exploration of non-human, technological, and ecological relations. In her seminal work _A Cyborg Manifesto_, Donna Haraway critiques the boundaries between human and machine, nature and culture, arguing for a reimagining of identity beyond these dichotomies. Haraway’s cyborg, a hybrid of organism and machine, serves as a metaphor for transcending the limitations of traditional humanism and embracing a more fluid, interconnected, and boundary-defying conception of existence. This aligns with posthuman thought, which emphasizes the need to reconsider humanity’s place within a broader, more complex network of relationships involving technology, nature, and the non-human. See Haraway, Donna J. "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century." Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature, Routledge, 1991.

62. Tönnies contrasts _Gemeinschaft_ (community) and _Gesellschaft_ (society), with the latter emphasizing impersonal, transactional relationships. In the context of _nonplaces_, _Gesellschaft_ reflects the erosion of personal identity and community, as modern spaces prioritize function over connection, mirroring societal fragmentation. See Tönnies, Ferdinand. _Community and Society (Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft)._ Translated by Charles P. Loomis, Harper & Row, 1957. [↑](#endnote-ref-62)

63. Lukács critiques how capitalism alienates individuals and commodifies relationships, resulting in a disconnection from meaningful interaction. This mirrors the reification and anonymity of individuals in _nonplaces_ and modern society. See Lukács, Georg. _History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics_. Translated by Rodney Livingstone, MIT Press, 1971 [↑](#endnote-ref-63)

64. Pavlov’s research on _conditioned reflexes_ shows how behavior is shaped by environmental stimuli, which parallels how _nonplaces_ condition individuals to act predictably, stripping away personal identity in favor of mechanistic responses.

65. Hillary Clinton's reference to the "basket of deplorables" in her speech at the LGBT for Hillary Gala in 2016 became highly controversial. Clinton used the term to describe a portion of Donald Trump’s supporters, whom she characterized as "racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic" and "basket of deplorables." The comment was widely criticized as divisive and dismissive, as it generalized and stigmatized a large group of voters. This rhetoric also highlights the broader societal tendency to categorize and marginalize individuals who exist outside the perceived mainstream, rendering them invisible or subhuman—much like the figures in _nonplaces_ who are overlooked, yet essential to the functioning of society.

66. This metaphor refers to the illusion of a unified, powerful authority that maintains order through fear and coercion, as envisioned by Thomas Hobbes in _Leviathan_. The idea is used here to critique the way marginalized groups—whether they are the so-called "basket of deplorables" or other excluded individuals—are drawn into supporting an ideal of order and security offered by a political system that ultimately maintains power for the elite. These are individuals that are caught in a cycle of dependence on a system that promises protection and advancement but keeps them in a subordinate, unseen position, much like the figures in _nonplaces_ who are physically present but remain unacknowledged or overlooked by society. See Hobbes, Thomas. _Leviathan_. Penguin Classics, 1982 [↑](#endnote-ref-66)

67. In Notes from Underground, the protagonist, the Underground Man, critiques modern rationality and its self-awareness, viewing excessive consciousness as a source of suffering rather than enlightenment. The statement reflects the existential despair that comes from contemplating one's existence, suggesting that even acute forms of self-awareness can alienate an individual from the world and lead to a debilitating sense of _anomie_. _Notes from Underground_.

68. A German term often translated as "sublation" in English. It is a key concept in Hegelian philosophy, which refers to the process by which a contradiction is overcome and preserved at a higher level of understanding. In Hegel's dialectic, _Aufhebung_ involves the simultaneous negation and preservation of elements, leading to their synthesis in a more comprehensive unity. This concept is central to understanding the dynamic and progressive nature of Hegelian thought, where each stage of development is both a resolution and a continuation of previous stages [↑](#endnote-ref-68)

69. Bergson’s often quoted phrase explored the idea that time and consciousness could not be fully captured by rigid, mechanical frameworks. He emphasized the importance of the unseen and the ineffable, arguing that the true essence of reality lies beyond what can be empirically observed and classified. For Bergson, this unseen realm—felt, intuited, and experienced in moments of deep reflection—contains a more profound understanding of existence that is often ignored by the dominant frameworks that prioritize visibility, control, and categorization. This idea parallels _Mythologies of the Heart_, where the invisible, imaginative, and dreamable becomes a source of power and potential, offering a space for the emergence of new possibilities.
