In *The Death of the Author*, Roland Barthes argues that the meaning of a text is not dictated by the author's intentions or biography but emerges in the act of reading. Once a work is published, it ceases to belong to the writer and is instead claimed by the reader, who reshapes its significance through interpretation. This radical shift in literary criticism—away from the authorial voice and toward the autonomy of the text—epitomized much of twentieth-century thought. The artist, once the sovereign creator, was decentered, and in this decentering, the art itself gained a kind of freedom.

We cannot know *‘who is speaking,’* or, put another way, we cannot identify *‘an author,’* because writing itself, or text, or textuality, has a certain characteristic that removes *‘voice’* and *‘origin.’* This is a poststructural viewpoint: that everything exists as an interrelated text, that there is no singular identity, only an agglomeration of sedimented cultural and historical forces. But what if this absence is a site of possibility? What if it gestures not toward a static human nature but toward perpetual becoming?

It is within this space of becoming that I situate my work — the nexus where identity, language, and power collapse and reassemble. This essay entitled **“Mythologies of the Heart”** is an exploration of how we construct the self through narrative; how the heart, both as an organ and as a metaphor, becomes a contested site of meaning. The heart is an organ of fiction; it beats in rhythms we do not fully control, and its betrayals are often more literary than medical. I am interested in how the heart is written into Being, how its failures and fractures are mapped through language, how desire and grief inscribe themselves onto the body and the inner geographies of the imagination. The heart is not merely an affective metaphor — it is a political battleground, a terrain where the self is made and unmade, where dominant structures attempt to dictate who is allowed to feel, to long, to suffer, and ultimately, to dream.

I write to make Derrida bleed and Didion theorize. This book, then, in some ways is that very manifesto, my rebellion, and my offering — a reimagining of creative nonfiction as a site of both radical theoretical and emotional possibility. I write not to document experience but to dismantle the boundaries between philosophy, memoir, and activism, forging a new language for what it means to exist in — and resist — the Machine’s logic. At its core, *Mythologies of the Heart* is an experiment in form and thought, where footnotes become nervous systems, subway platforms intersect with quantum fields, and grief metastasizes into a methodology for revolution.

I begin by reclaiming Roland Barthes’ “mythologies,” not as tools of ideological critique but as generative existential structures. Here, the subway station is no mere transit zone but a Deleuzian war machine, its fluorescent hum a chorus of becoming. The bureaucratic labyrinths I’ve navigated across time and space are not just Kafkaesque nightmares — they are biopolitical blueprints, their sterile language dissected in real time through unsent letters to Victoria, a ghost who haunts these pages. The footnotes littered throughout the text are not citations. They are, in some ways, a parallel text, pulsing with theoretical fervor. Wittgenstein’s *“limits of language”* collide with the metallic taste of grief as I fail to articulate my cousin Caleb’s murder; Augé’s “non-places” bleed into collegiate Gothic architecture, exposing ivy-draped façades as monuments to neoliberal aspiration. This is theory made flesh, philosophy that sweats and bleeds.

Central to this work is **The Politics of the Dreamable** — a praxis of resistance forged in liminal spaces. I reject the flattening gaze of algorithms and carceral systems, opting instead to occupy voids: the lacunae between footnotes, the arrhythmia of a heart denied closure, the bureaucratic interstices where meaning dissolves. Caleb’s death is not just a personal tragedy but a case study in systemic violence, analyzed through a fusion of critical race theory and quantum realism. Love, too, becomes a battleground. My unsent letters to Victoria are not confessional indulgences but Derridean specters, haunting the text with what might have been. In these spaces, I help to embody micro-emancipations: acts of refusal as small as a skipped meeting, as vast as redefining love itself as a “non-place” of perpetual becoming.

The heart, often dismissed as sentimental, becomes my phenomenal laboratory. I practice **cardio-phenomenology** — tracking how joy, grief, and longing reshape our internal geographies. To love under late capitalism, I argue, is to dwell in a haunted non-place: a Schrödinger’s Gadfly, both present and disruptive, yet perpetually unobserved. This emotional onto-epistemology challenges the history of Western philosophy’s mind-body binary, insisting that the heart knows in ways the intellect could never parse. When I write *“the heart is an organ of fiction,”* I confess its role in metabolizing trauma into bearable myth — but also its power to fictionalize new futures.

Structurally, this work is a rhizome. Its footnotes deterritorialize the text, inviting readers to choose their path: linger with Baudrillard’s simulacra, surface for air with Victoria’s ghost, or trace the algorithmic violence embedded in subway delay announcements. The form itself is the argument — a rejection of linear authority, a manifesto in fragments in the lineage of Fernando Pessoa. To engage with this work is to participate in its rebellion. I offer no tidy conclusions, only urgent provocations: Can a love letter be a Post-Marxist critique? Does Affect encode resistance? Can we weaponize erasure against Machineries that have rendered it invisible? *Mythologies of the Heart*, then, is not just an essay but an insurrection — one fought with citations, arrhythmias, and the relentless belief that another world is not only dreamable but possible. Here, in the gaps between what is said and unsaid, I build altars to the possible. This is creative nonfiction reimagined as theoretical revolt — beyond the confines of the Ivory Tower.

*“The struggle I face is the gap between wanting to express what’s inside me and the feeling that I can’t fully do so. But I don’t see this as a flaw — it’s just part of how things are. Language itself is limiting, and in many ways, the limits of language reflect the limits of our world. Change, then, often begins in the mind, in those quiet moments of dreaming, wishing, or imagining. These dreams are often subconscious, desires buried deep within us that eventually emerge as what I call mythologies. These mythologies are a type of autotheory — they are the philosophical fictions we narrativize to ourselves to understand who we were, who we are, and who we might become.*”
