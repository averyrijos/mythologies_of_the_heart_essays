## The Heart's Labyrinth

Throughout human history, the heart has been revered as far more than a crude biological pump. Ancient civilizations across civilizations attributed profound emotional, spiritual, and intellectual significance to the organ, often considering it the very seat of both human emotion and consciousness. This perspective, known academically as the “cardiocentric hypothesis”<sup><sup>[\[79\]](#endnote-79)</sup></sup>, positioned the heart as the primary locus of emotion, cognition, and awareness long before modern science revealed the brain's central role in these functions. Ancient peoples observed that emotional states corresponded with changes in heart rhythm and sensation, leading to a rich tapestry of heart-centered beliefs that transcended geographical boundaries and influenced religion, medicine, philosophy, and cultural practices for millennia. From the weighing ceremonies of ancient Egypt to the philosophical debates of classical Greece, the heart's symbolic power has shaped human understanding of our emotional lives in ways that continue to resonate in contemporary metaphors and expressions.

The human recognition of the heart's significance predates written history by thousands of years. Archaeological evidence suggests that as early as 15,000 years ago, prehistoric humans had already begun to recognize the heart's vital importance. A cave painting in El Pindal, Spain depicts a mammoth with what appears to be a red heart in its chest, possibly drawn as a hunting target, indicating an early understanding that damaging this organ meant death for the animal.<sup><sup>[\[80\]](#endnote-80)</sup></sup> During this same prehistoric period, Cro-Magnon hunters in Europe incorporated heart symbols into pictograms, though their exact meaning remains mysterious. These early representations reveal humanity's longstanding awareness of the heart's crucial role in sustaining life.

By the time permanent human settlements emerged approximately 12,000 years ago, this fundamental recognition had likely evolved into more complex understandings about the heart's central importance to human existence. The transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural communities coincided with more sophisticated observations about the body's functions, setting the stage for the elaborate heart-centered belief systems that would later develop in the world's earliest civilizations. This prehistoric foundation would ultimately blossom into the rich cardiocentric traditions that dominated human understanding of emotions and consciousness for thousands of years.

Perhaps no ancient civilization elevated the heart to greater importance than Egypt, where it stood at the center of an elaborate religious and philosophical worldview. From approximately 3500-1000 BCE, Egyptians considered the heart (or "_ib_") not only the center of emotions but also the repository of intelligence, memory, morality, and personhood itself Ma'at was an ancient Egyptian concept and deity representing truth, justice, cosmic order, and moral balance. In Egyptian mythology, she's depicted as a goddess wearing an ostrich feather. As mentioned previously, during the afterlife judgment, a person's heart would be weighed against Ma'at's feather. If the heart was heavier than the feather due to sins and wrongdoings, it would be devoured. If the heart balanced with the feather, the person would achieve eternal life.

Ancient civilizations, then, saw the heart as far more than a physical organ, blurring the lines between the physical and metaphysical realms. In ancient Egypt, the heart (_ib_) was considered supremely important in both physical and spiritual contexts. While other organs were removed during mummification, the heart itself remained in the body—Egyptians believed it held a person's essence and would be weighed against the feather of _Ma'at_ in the afterlife judgment. This understanding represents one of humanity's earliest links between the heart and a person's moral character, emotional life, and fundamental nature.

So crucial was this judgment that Egyptians developed protective measures to ensure favorable outcomes. Heart scarabs—amulets shaped like beetles or hearts and inscribed with magical spells—were placed over the deceased's heart to prevent it from "betraying" its owner during the weighing ceremony. These protective charms highlight the heart's perceived agency and its role as not merely a passive vessel of emotions but an active participant in one's ethical and spiritual destiny.

The ancient Greek understanding of the heart, in turn, evolved through centuries of philosophical and medical inquiry, establishing frameworks that would influence Western thought for millennia. Between 400-200 BCE, Greek thinkers positioned the heart as both the center of the soul and the physical source of heat within the body. This dual conception integrated spiritual beliefs with early physiological observations, as Greek scholars and physicians such as Hippocrates and Aristotle recognized connections between the heart and lungs and demonstrated awareness of the heart's pumping action. The transition into classical antiquity brought remarkable developments in understanding the heart's role.

Ancient Greek physicians and philosophers, particularly Aristotle, revolutionized how the heart was perceived in both medical and philosophical contexts. Aristotle's extensive writings positioned the heart as the supreme center of vital functions, describing it as the "acropolis" of the body. He developed detailed theories about how the heart generated and distributed vital heat throughout the body, considering it the seat of intelligence, motion, and sensation. His observations of embryological development, noting the heart as the first organ to develop and the last to cease functioning, further reinforced his beliefs. In contrast to modern understanding, Aristotle viewed the brain primarily as a cooling mechanism for the blood heated by the heart, a theory that would persist for centuries.

This physiological understanding profoundly reinforced the heart's metaphorical significance as life's central essence. The Stoic philosophers, particularly Chrysippus and Zeno, furthered this connection between the heart and emotion, developing the sophisticated concept of "pathē" (passions). They argued that these passions were physically located in the heart and needed careful regulation through reason. This philosophical tradition established the heart-mind dualism that would become deeply embedded in Western thought, influencing everything from medicine to literature for over two millennia.<sup><sup>[\[81\]](#endnote-81)</sup></sup>

Roman understanding largely built upon Greek foundations while making distinct contributions. Romans recognized the heart as absolutely vital to sustaining life, as reflected in the writings of Ovid, who noted that "Although Aesculapius himself applies the herbs, by no means can he cure a wound of the heart". The most significant Roman contribution came through Galen, personal physician to Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who made important anatomical observations regarding heart valves and ventricles and distinguished between veins and arteries.<sup><sup>[\[82\]](#endnote-82)</sup></sup> Despite failing to fully understand circulation, Galen's work represented the height of classical cardiological knowledge and would remain influential through the Middle Ages.<sup><sup>[\[83\]](#endnote-83)</sup></sup>

The medieval period witnessed an extraordinary flourishing of heart symbolism, particularly through the dual channels of Christianity and courtly love traditions. In Christian theology, the Sacred Heart of Jesus emerged as a powerful devotional symbol representing divine love, sacrifice, and spiritual transformation. The image of Christ's heart, often depicted as wounded and surrounded by thorns, became central to medieval piety and artistic expression. Simultaneously, secular traditions elevated the heart to new symbolic heights through courtly love poetry, where knights pledged their hearts to noble ladies, establishing the heart as the definitive organ of romantic devotion. This period saw the development of elaborate heart imagery in manuscripts, architecture, and personal tokens, creating a rich visual language around cardiac symbolism.<sup><sup>[\[84\]](#endnote-84)</sup></sup>

Medical understanding during this era remained heavily influenced by Galen's theories, which positioned the heart within a sophisticated tripartite model of human vitality. Alongside the brain and liver, the heart was seen as one of three primary centers of life force, each governing different aspects of human existence. This tripartite model suggested the heart governed emotional and passionate aspects of existence while the brain controlled rational thought. Medieval physicians expanded on these ideas, developing complex theories about how the heart's movements and temperatures influenced personality and emotional states.

The Renaissance marked a fascinating period of tension between emerging scientific understanding and persistent symbolic associations. William Harvey's groundbreaking discovery of blood circulation in 1628 revolutionized understanding of the heart's physical function. His detailed experiments and observations, published in "De Motu Cordis," demonstrated how the heart acted as a muscular pump, systematically moving blood through a closed circulatory system.<sup><sup>[\[85\]](#endnote-85)</sup></sup> This discovery gradually began separating scientific understanding from metaphorical associations, initiating a new era in cardiac medicine. However, the transition was not immediate or complete. Artists and anatomists of the period, including Leonardo da Vinci and Andreas Vesalius, produced works that straddled both worlds.

Their anatomical drawings, while increasingly accurate in their physical depictions, often retained stylistic elements that emphasized the heart's special status. This duality reflected the broader cultural struggle to reconcile emerging scientific knowledge with deeply ingrained symbolic and spiritual traditions. This resilience of heart symbolism despite scientific advancement speaks to what "Mythologies of the Heart" describes as the heart's function in creating "the narratives we tell ourselves about who we are, who we love, where we come from, and where we aspire to go." The manuscript highlights how these mythologies "can be both illusions and truths, as well as both illusory and true simultaneously," reflecting the complex, sometimes contradictory ways we've historically understood the heart.

While Mediterranean civilizations developed their cardiocentric traditions, a parallel but distinctive understanding of the heart emerged in ancient China.<sup><sup>[\[86\]](#endnote-86)</sup></sup> Dating back to approximately 2600 BCE, Chinese medical philosophy positioned the heart as both the seat of intelligence and the mind. This dual conception is reflected in the Chinese word "_xin_," which simultaneously meant both "heart" and "mind," revealing a conceptual unity that differed from the eventual Western separation of these faculties.

The Chinese medical classic _Huangdi Neijing_ (The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine)<sup><sup>[\[87\]](#endnote-87)</sup></sup> articulated the heart's supreme role, describing it as a "kind and benevolent emperor" that ruled the body when health was balanced. This imperial metaphor reveals how Chinese medicine integrated political and social concepts with physiological understanding, viewing the body as a harmonious kingdom with the heart as its rightful sovereign. Some scholars suggest that Chinese physicians may have understood aspects of blood circulation some 4,000 years before William Harvey's formal discovery in the West, indicating sophisticated observational knowledge underlying their heart-centered philosophy.

The Chinese conception differed from Western traditions in its emphasis on harmony and balance rather than the oppositional frameworks that characterized Greek debates between cardiocentric and cephalocentric views. Rather than positioning the heart against other organs in a hierarchy of importance, Chinese medicine emphasized the interconnected nature of bodily systems, with the heart serving as the central organizing principle. This holistic perspective placed emotional equilibrium at the center of health, with heart function intimately tied to emotional states in a reciprocal relationship that blurred Western distinctions between cause and effect.<sup><sup>[\[88\]](#endnote-88)</sup></sup>

The persistence of heart-centered emotional language across cultures and time raises a fundamental question: why did so many ancient civilizations independently associate emotions with the heart rather than other organs? The answer lies partly in observable physiological responses. As one commentator notes, "The adrenaline surge from any strong emotion has a powerful effect on our heart rate, so naturally we feel the pangs of love and attraction in our chest first"[7](https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/how-did-the-heart-become-synonymous-with-love). This immediate, visceral connection between emotional states and cardiac sensations provided a compelling experiential foundation for cardiocentric beliefs. Early anatomical observations reinforced these experiential associations. Ancient Egyptians noticed that "the veins and arteries, as well as many nerves, radiate outwards from the heart," leading them to conclude it controlled both physical and emotional functions.<sup><sup>[\[89\]](#endnote-89)</sup></sup> Similarly, early Greek experiments in anatomy revealed that "as nerves were followed around the body, the vast majority seemed to lead to the solar plexus in the chest," strengthening the theory that the heart-controlled emotion and reason.

The heart's responses to emotional stimuli are particularly noticeable during intense feelings like fear, excitement, and attraction. When one becomes excited (due to fear, or, libidinally) the viscerality of a heart beating faster became associated with intense emotional experience. This empirical correlation made the heart a natural candidate for the source of emotional experience. Additionally, emotional distress often produces physical sensations in the chest—the "broken heart" feeling that seems to create a literal physical pain when experiencing loss. These physiological realities made the heart-emotion connection intuitively compelling across diverse cultures, helping explain why similar beliefs emerged independently in civilizations with limited contact.<sup><sup>[\[90\]](#endnote-90)</sup></sup>

Even as scientific understanding has relocated the physiological basis of emotions to the brain and endocrine system, these visceral cardiac responses ensure that heart-centered emotional metaphors remain psychologically meaningful. The racing heart of excitement and the heavy heart of sadness continue to be felt experiences, maintaining the heart's prominence in emotional philosophy and phenomenological language even as its primacy in medical understanding has diminished.

Religious manifestations of heart symbolism were particularly profound. In Egypt, the heart's judgment formed the cornerstone of morality and afterlife beliefs. The Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, written nearly 5,000 years ago, contains what may be the earliest reference to pulse-taking: "I touch his heart but it does not beat at all"<sup><sup>[\[91\]](#endnote-91)</sup></sup>. The epic also describes a heart sacrifice to the sun god Shamash, demonstrating the heart's ritual significance. These religious associations elevated the heart beyond mere physiology to become a central religious and cultural symbol.

Artistic representations of the heart evolved significantly over time. While the modern heart symbol bears little resemblance to the anatomical organ, its symbolic lineage stretches back to prehistoric times. The familiar double-lobed icon with a point at the bottom developed primarily during the Middle Ages, becoming a universal symbol that transcended language barriers. This stylized representation emerged alongside increasingly accurate anatomical drawings of the heart, revealing how scientific and symbolic understandings developed along parallel tracks.

The heart's cultural significance extended to language itself, creating metaphorical frameworks that have shown remarkable persistence. Expressions like "following one's heart," having a "change of heart," or feeling "heartbroken" transcend cultural boundaries and continue to shape how we conceptualize and express emotional experiences. This linguistic legacy represents perhaps the most enduring aspect of the ancient cardiocentric worldview, persisting in everyday speech even as scientific understanding has evolved.

Kendrick Lamar's _LOVE._ and _FEEL._ from his Pulitzer Prize winning album _DAMN._ (2017) provide two deeply introspective perspectives on human emotion, exploring love as an external relationship and feeling as an internal reckoning. When analyzed through the lens of the _Mythologies of the Heart_ and contemporary discourses on emotion, these songs reveal a nuanced exploration of desire, vulnerability, and existential tension. Lamar’s treatment of the heart aligns with both historical mythologies—where the heart has been a seat of emotion, morality, and memory—and contemporary neuropsychological understandings, which frame emotions as cognitive and embodied responses.<sup><sup>[\[92\]](#endnote-92)</sup></sup>

In _LOVE._, Lamar constructs a mythology of love through vulnerability and uncertainty. The song’s chorus—_“If I didn’t ride, blade on curb, would you still love me?”_—evokes a conditional framework, questioning the endurance of affection beyond status and performance. Love here is defined as an end that requires proof, sacrifice, and navigation through trials and tribulations. Does this not hearken to the heart-weighing ceremony of the Egyptians?

Lamar’s artistic phenomenology also aligns with the _Mythologies_ _of the Heart’s_ concept of love and the heart as a non-place. The song resists closure, posing questions rather than offering resolutions echoing the previous statement that love is an “unbroken tether, a perpetual movement through the panoramic vistas of our inner worlds”. The heart here, as Lamar articulates, is both sanctuary and uncertainty, always poised between longing and fulfillment. Unlike _LOVE._, which externalizes emotion in the form of relational uncertainty, _FEEL._ delves inward, capturing the paradox of emotional intensity in a world that renders sentimentality isolating. The song’s repetition of _“I feel like…”_ constructs an almost frenetic energy of emotions—betrayal, abandonment, exhaustion—mirroring the pervasive fragmentation of contemporary subjectivities, coinciding with the _Mythologies of the Heart_'s assertion that the heart functions as a “palimpsest, a layered text where new inscriptions are made over the faint lines of old ones”​ Lamar’s lyrics in this song express a self both burdened by and alienated from feeling, encapsulating a broader cultural malaise where emotional excess is paradoxically accompanied by detachment. This undoubtedly reflects a shift from classical cardiocentric models—where the heart was a singular, coherent seat of emotion. Now, we might look towards a postmodern, posthuman understanding of emotions as transient, context-dependent, and shaped by and mediated through external forces – namely ecosystems, digital media, neoliberalism, and societies of control.<sup><sup>[\[93\]](#endnote-93)</sup></sup>

The interplay between presence and absence in _FEEL._ also mirrors the _Mythologies’_ discussion of hauntology, where emotions are not merely present experiences but are reverberations of past interactions​. Lamar’s refrain—_“Ain’t nobody praying for me”_—denotes an awareness of this absence, a yearning for emotional continuity that feels ever out of reach. This is a modern iteration of the historical heart’s role as a site of longing, reconfigured in a world where affect is increasingly mediated and alienated thorough mechanisms of surveillance, control, and exclusion.

Lamar’s _LOVE._ and _FEEL._ ultimately portray the heart not as a static, isolated entity but as a dynamic space of navigation—a locus of feeling where vulnerability, desire, and existential questioning unfold in real time. Like the _Mythologies of the Heart_, Lamar’s work exemplifies how the heart is not simply a repository of feeling but a shifting landscape of emotional and symbolic configurations. In this framing, the heart is best understood not as a maze—a structure riddled with dead ends and designed to trap—but as a labyrinth, a sinuous passage leading toward a marvelous center.<sup><sup>[\[94\]](#endnote-94)</sup></sup>

A maze is meant to confuse, its paths leading to frustration, bewilderment, and failure. A labyrinth, by contrast, is an intentional journey inward. There are no false turns, only a path that bends, loops, and coils back on itself until one reaches the “heart” of the matter. Love, as articulated in _LOVE._, is not an endpoint but a journey—an unfolding movement toward deeper understanding. Feeling, as expressed in _FEEL._, is not something to be conquered but to be traversed, navigated in its complexity. The heart, then, is not a puzzle to be solved but a process of becoming, a space where we encounter ourselves and others in motion. In every mythology, in every historical and contemporary conception of the heart, what remains is this: it is a structure that calls us inward. Whether in the Egyptian _weighing of the heart_, the Stoic disciplining of _pathē_, or Kendrick’s urgent search for meaning in a fractured world, the heart is always a site of passage. And at its center, if we are willing to make the journey, it is not a trap, not an exitless void, but a meeting place—where love and feeling, history and presence, self and other converge in buoyant openness, tangled within an ever-evolving embrace.

81. The Stoic view of the heart as the seat of passions was not merely metaphorical but deeply physiological, rooted in the medical theories of their time. Galen, by localizing reason in the brain rather than the heart, foreshadowed the Cartesian mind-body dualism. However, the Stoic perspective persisted in cultural imaginaries, shaping poetic and philosophical conceptions of emotional life well into the modern era. Even today, traces of this legacy remain in everyday expressions—one “follows one’s heart” or suffers from “heartache,” as if Stoic passions still pulse within us. [↑](#endnote-ref-81)

83. Ovid’s writings, such as the reference to Aesculapius and the heart, reflect the period's recognition of the heart’s centrality to life and health. Galen, building upon earlier Greek anatomical studies, advanced knowledge of the cardiovascular system, notably distinguishing veins from arteries and making early observations of the heart’s valves and ventricles. Although his failure to understand blood circulation limited his theories, Galen's work became the cornerstone of medical understanding for centuries, influencing both medieval and Renaissance thought on cardiac function. _See:_ Heart in History - PBS." _American Experience_, WGBH Educational Foundation, 13 Mar. 2025, _pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/partners-heart-history/_ [↑](#endnote-ref-83)

84. The medieval period saw the heart emerge as a profound symbol in both religious and secular contexts. In Christian theology, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, often depicted as a bleeding heart crowned with thorns, became a central symbol of Christ’s love, sacrifice, and salvation, as popularized through devotional practices like the Sacred Heart devotion. At the same time, courtly love traditions, exemplified by poets such as Dante and Petrarch, elevated the heart as the ultimate symbol of chivalric devotion, often idealizing the heart as the seat of romantic and emotional commitment. These intertwined spiritual and romantic associations contributed to a rich cultural iconography surrounding the heart, seen in manuscripts, art, and personal relics throughout the period.

85. William Harvey’s discovery of blood circulation, published in _De Motu Cordis_ (1628), challenged existing views on the heart's function, marking a pivotal shift in the understanding of human physiology. His work, alongside earlier anatomical contributions from Leonardo da Vinci and Andreas Vesalius, demonstrated a blend of empirical observation and artistic representation that exemplified the Renaissance's dual engagement with science and symbolism. Harvey's findings set the foundation for modern cardiology, yet the metaphorical and symbolic associations of the heart continued to influence both medical and cultural interpretations for centuries.

88. The Chinese conception of the heart in the _Huangdi Neijing_ resonates with certain principles found in Buddhist phenomenology, particularly the idea of interconnectedness and the centrality of consciousness in both the physical and mental realms. In Chinese medicine, the heart is depicted as an emperor, embodying the concept of _Qi_—a vital life force that flows through the body, maintaining harmony and balance. This mirrors Buddhist teachings, which emphasize the interconnectedness of body and mind, as well as the fluidity of experience. Buddhist phenomenology suggests that consciousness and emotional states are not isolated from the body, but rather are deeply entwined with it, much like the heart's role in regulating both physical and emotional health. The holistic view of the heart as a governing force, with its role in emotional equilibrium, parallels Buddhist ideas of mind-body unity, where mental states influence physical health and vice versa. The absence of a strict mind-body dualism in Chinese medicine and Buddhism contrasts with Western traditions, which often see the mind and body as separate entities in opposition. _See:_ Kuiji. _A Comprehensive Commentary on the Heart Sutra (Prajñāpāramita-hr̥daya-Sūtra)_.

90. The connection between the heart and emotion can also be understood through the lens of embodied cognition, a theory suggesting that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with its environment. Rather than emotions being purely abstract mental states, they are experienced and understood through bodily sensations, such as the racing heart in fear or excitement. This perspective aligns with contemporary research in affective neuroscience, which shows that emotions are not merely processed in the brain but are dynamically shaped by physiological responses. The heart, as a central organ in these responses, thus becomes not just a metaphor but an active participant in emotional experience, reinforcing its historical and cross-cultural significance.

92. _DAMN._, released in 2017, represents a watershed moment in both hip-hop and contemporary music, showcasing Kendrick Lamar’s virtuosic mastery of narrative complexity, lyrical depth, and thematic exploration. The album interleaves personal reflection with broader cultural and societal critiques, addressing themes of identity, spirituality, race, and systemic oppression. Notably, _DAMN._ also demonstrates Lamar's versatility as an artist, blending elements of jazz, funk, and traditional hip-hop while maintaining a distinct sonic innovation. The album’s storytelling is marked by its vulnerability, introspection, and social commentary, making it a significant contribution to the phenomenological discourse surrounding the Black experience in modern American life. Lamar’s innovative use of narrative structure, such as the duality of the album's final tracks, challenges listeners to engage with the album in multiple ways. _DAMN._'s critical and commercial success, including winning the Pulitzer Prize for Music, cemented Lamar's place as a cultural force, amplifying the voice of marginalized communities while also pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved within hip-hop as an artistic medium.

93. The tracks _LOVE._ and _FEEL._ from _DAMN._ offer a nuanced exploration of emotion, identity, and internal conflict, reflecting Kendrick Lamar’s characteristic introspection and lyrical complexity. _LOVE._ features a collaboration with Zacari and explores themes of loyalty, trust, and the vulnerability inherent in romantic relationships. Its smooth, melodic production contrasts with the intense emotional weight of Lamar’s lyrics, creating a tension between love’s beauty and its fragility. The track reflects Lamar’s ongoing engagement with human connection, questioning the sincerity and durability of affection in the face of fame and personal struggles.

    In contrast, _FEEL._ delves into the artist’s internal struggles with fame, pressure, and existential despair. The song’s sparse, haunting production complements Lamar’s raw, almost confessional delivery, as he articulates feelings of being misunderstood, detached, and overwhelmed by the near-messianic expectations placed upon him by the Culture. _FEEL._ stands as one of the most emotionally intense tracks on _DAMN._, offering a glimpse into the psychological toll of Lamar’s success.

94. The labyrinth, a symbol with roots in both ancient myth and architectural design, has held a deep cultural significance throughout history. Its earliest known origins can be traced to Minoan Crete, where the labyrinth was depicted in art and legend, particularly in the myth of the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull creature that resided in a labyrinth built by Daedalus. The Minoan labyrinth was often seen as a symbol of complexity and mystery, a physical space designed to confuse and trap. Over time, the labyrinth evolved in various cultures, becoming a powerful metaphor for spiritual journeys, personal transformation, and the search for meaning. In medieval Christianity, the labyrinth was incorporated into cathedral floors, often as a tool for meditation and pilgrimage, symbolizing the pilgrim’s journey to salvation. During the Renaissance, the labyrinth took on new forms in gardens and architecture, embodying both aesthetic beauty and intellectual challenge. _See_: Graves, Robert. _The Greek Myths_.
