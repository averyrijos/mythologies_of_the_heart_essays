## Modern Estrangements

Life at its best is a reluctant inconvenience. The mechanics. The minutiae. The schedules and calendars. The pleasantries. Late-capitalism is pervasively artifice. The debt collectors call. The line is monitored and recorded. Quality assurance and training purposes. I swipe right. I swipe left. I match. I get a message from a phishing account or a bot. I apply to jobs that don’t really exist. If they do, there are hundreds of applicants. Many of the listings require a college degree and experience. God forbid you have a master’s degree and are overqualified. They call it market equilibrium. Wanting the best “talent” at the most affordable price. Don’t forget Schrodinger’s Resume. Needing experience when you can’t even obtain it. The politicians are being bought before our eyes, yet they maintain the decorum. They talk about “Americans” like we fundamentally have things in common. Washington Consensus politics. Corporations are ending DEI left and right. Every oligarch is bending over to kiss the ring. The gilded age of democracy — a thin veneer that masks the languorous rot within. Yet, the machine wants us to continue on. Business as usual. Yet, we all know things have gone awry. When tyranny has become normalized, only subservience or revolution remain. But the revolution will not be fought with guns and knives but with art and solidarity.

That is why the Machine bans the books. That is why they attempt to control the narratives. Why they censor dissent and control the mechanisms of access. Dominating us with systems of legitimization. With mechanisms of filtration. The Machine replaces class warfare with sectarian politics. It divides us along racial, ethnic, and cultural lines. It curates our news feeds. Our Instagram reels. Classifying, dividing, organizing. Classifying, dividing, organizing. Tracing our cookie crumbs across the ethers of cyberspace when we were just looking for the jar. We could boycott. But what if the most affordable means are housed in a Walmart? What if your safe food is a McChicken? Your “third space” a Starbucks? Your life-saving medicine, animal-tested?

All of this is to say, that we are indubitably dominated. Yet, I am here to proclaim that although we may have lost the battle, we will win the war. But it may involve learning or, more specifically, unlearning. Disremembering what we think we know, embracing a kind of Neo-Pyrrhonian skepticism. The Machine forcibly interiorized us. It has overwritten our inner narratives, promoting the dogmas of consumption. Parroting the doctrines of individualism. It tells us we need more therapy in self-control in a sick society. It says to us that we too can be “great.” We might become the next Carnegie. The next Bezos or Musk. That we can “consume” our way to sustainability. It whispers the myth of the self-made man. It says this as if we aren’t always in perpetual relation, materially entangled to the greater Order of Things. As if we do not rely on our peers, our families, our communities. Steve jobs had a great point when he stated, in an email to himself, “I did not invent the transistor (…) when I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.” Even the Untouchables among us — the most seemingly “accomplished” — are not islands unto themselves. What we must reclaim, more than ever in the twenty-first century is the power of the communitarian. The power of the collective.

This power begets connection, vulnerability, and courage. It means that, in a system that divides, we must erect bridges. That in a world dominated by the myth of the Man, we must create new fictions that will sustain us. That in order to deterritorialize the despot, we must inhabit it from within. We must use its weapons against itself. We must weaponize its language, its regimes of routinization, and its methods of operation. By subverting it with the brunt of its own contradictory logic, we create radical potentials for revolutionary changes. The system that has pushed us to the fringes have erred in their logic. By our very vantage point, those situated on the peripheries might catch a glimpse of the system in totality. The geometries of resistance. A Deimos on a distally axial orbit. Cursory satellites.

Erasure’s powers are too faulty, the machine’s instruments too crude, too blunt and ineffectual, to combat the powers of connection. The powers of love itself. Of the resilience of the human heart. The locus and the seat of our emotionality. Of our Affects. For it was once said that in the thralls of winter there is, within us, an invincible summer. So, for us this praxis means not only inventing new ways of expressing thought but new ways of Being. Of relating to one another, Of relating to nature, the world, and the greater Order of Things. Building communities of support connection and interrelation. Building windows where there were once walls. It means we must relinquish control and acknowledge our dependence on one another, our communities, our friends, and the countless strangers that make all our lives possible. The undergird of laborers that support us. The systems of care and love that sustain us. The art that gently remind us of the strange, wondrous gift of existence. Ways of being will require a new ethic. A world based on relationality rather than atomicity. Care rather than control. Cooperation over domination. This will be the new foundation. A beginning for a new world. The seedling of an unblemished Eden.

In 1937, Pablo Picasso, one of the world’s most famous artists, completed and presented an art piece called _Guernica_, which is a paradigmatic example of art functioning as revolutionary praxis. The mural-sized painting is monumental, which weaponizes abstraction to confront fascist violence. _Guernica_ was created in response to the Nazi-condoned bombing of Basque civilians during the Spanish Civil War. _Guernica_ countered Francisco Franco’s censorship regime. While fascist forces denied the attack occurred. Picasso’s fractured Cubist figures — the screaming mother, dismembered soldier, and agonized horse, became almost forensic evidence of state violence.

The painting is colored in a monochromatic palette (graphite grays and newsprint whites) mirrors the desensitizing effect of then black-and-white war photography. Yet at 10ft x 25ft scale the art piece forces visceral engagement. The sheer scale of the artwork forces the onlookers’ gazes, making such viewers complicit witnesses rather than passive bystanders. During its 1938–39 international tour, the painting became a mobile protest site. Over 2 million viewers transformed gallery visits into anti-fascist assemblies. Franco supporters labeled it propaganda, while Spanish Republicans saw it as a “testimony to civilian suffering.” Guernica was seen as such a weapon against Soviet aesthetics; the CIA even covertly promoted _Guernica_ in 1950s Europe as a “weapon” against the Soviet regime, ironically leveraging its anti-fascist message for Cold War propaganda

George Steer’s 1937 _Times_ article about the Guernica bombing — which inspired Picasso — set a template for pairing art with journalism to humanize conflicts MoMA’s 1939 exhibition framed the painting as a “universal anti-war statement,” amplified by global press coverage. Even today, the artwork has continued contemporary resonance. During Syria’s civil war and Ukraine invasion, social media users overlaid _Guernica_ fragments onto bombed cities, creating viral “augmented reality protests.” Even a tapestry replica at the UN Security Council was controversially covered during Colin Powell’s 2003 Iraq War speech, highlighting its enduring power to shame militarism.

Thus, _Guernica_ stands as a testament to art’s capacity for resistance and revolution. Like Picasso’s masterpiece, our contemporary struggle against modern estrangement requires similar acts of creative defiance. We must craft new narratives, new symbols, and new ways of being that challenge the Machine’s dominion. Through art, through community, through radical acts of care and connection, we can transform the very structures that seek to alienate us. The revolution begins not with violence, but with vision — the vision of a world where human dignity supersedes profit, where collective wellbeing outweighs individual gain, and where the bonds between us are stronger than the forces that would tear us apart. In the end, modern estrangement is not our destiny but our challenge. By acknowledging our fundamental interconnectedness and embracing our capacity for collective action, we can begin to dismantle the artificial barriers that separate us from each other and from our own humanity. The path forward lies not in retreat or resignation, but in reimagining, rebuilding and dreaming — together.And so, we arrive not at an end, but at a threshold—a pause in the labyrinth where the heart’s echoes reverberate, refusing silence. The _Mythologies of the Heart_ are not a doctrine to be preached nor a map to be followed to some promised land. They are, instead, the quiet murmurs of what persists: the unseen, the unfelt, the unformed. They are the altars we build in the gaps, the spaces between words, between breaths, between the lives we live and the lives we dream. Here, in this non-place, the heart remains both sanctuary and frontier, a site of perpetual becoming where absence is not a void but a presence waiting to be named.

To dream under the Machine’s gaze is to commit an act of rebellion. To love in a world that commodifies connection is to wield a weapon forged in fragility. The politics of the dreamable does not promise utopia; it offers something fiercer—a _refusal_ to surrender the _possible_ to the _inevitable_. In the subway’s hum, in the unsent letter’s silence, in the memory of Caleb’s laugh or Victoria’s gaze, we find the raw material of resistance. These are not escapes but stubborn insistences: that the heart, with all its fractures, still beats toward something greater than mere survival. Modern estrangement seeks to sever us—from one another, from ourselves, from the earth beneath our feet. Yet, in the rubble of its artifice, we gather the shards. We weave new fictions, not to deny the Real but to expand it. Like Picasso’s _Guernica_, we paint our dissent in broad strokes and quiet whispers, knowing that art and solidarity are the tools of a revolution that need no blood to spill. The Machine may classify, divide, and organize, but it cannot erase the pulse of our collective longing, the stubborn resilience of a heart that dares to imagine beyond its confines. This is not a conclusion, for the heart knows no finality. It is an invitation—to saunter forward, as I have, through the geographies of self and the peripheries of the Other. To inhabit the non-places with courage, to dream with eyes wide open. The Mythologies of the Heart are ours to craft, ours to carry, ours to share. They are the stories that sustain us when the world inevitably grows cold, the fictions that remind us of our power to reshape what is into what could be. In the end—or rather, in the absence of an end—we are not merely wanderers in the labyrinth. We are its architects, its journeymen, its dreamers. And in our hands, the heart remains an unfinished altar, a testament to the invincible summer within us all. Let us build, then, not toward closure, but toward possibility. Let us dream, not in isolation, but in chorus. For in the heart’s labyrinth, every step is a beginning, every silence a song, every absence a call to create. This is the politics of the dreamable. These are the myths that sustain us.
